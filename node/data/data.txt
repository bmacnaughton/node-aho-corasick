MYRIELIn 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D---- He wasan old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the seeof D---- since 1806.Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substanceof what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merelyfor the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the variousrumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the verymoment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is saidof men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above allin their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of acouncillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobilityof the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir ofhis own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty,in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent inparliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was saidthat Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed,though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; thewhole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world andto gallantry.The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; theparliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of theRevolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which shehad long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fateof M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fallof his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps,even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance,with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas ofrenunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst ofthese distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenlysmitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimesoverwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastropheswould not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No onecould have told: all that was known was, that when he returned fromItaly he was a priest.In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He was alreadyadvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected withhis curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris.Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for hisparishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperorhad come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in theanteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon,on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man,turned round and said abruptly:--"Who is this good man who is staring at me?""Sire," said M. Myriel, "you are looking at a good man, and I at a greatman. Each of us can profit by it."That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure,and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn thathe had been appointed Bishop of D----What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented asto the early portion of M. Myriel's life? No one knew. Very few familieshad been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and becausehe was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his namewas connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less thanwords--palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and ofresidence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation whichengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen intoprofound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one wouldhave dared to recall them.M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster,Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as MademoiselleBaptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been theservant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid toMademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; sherealized the ideal expressed by the word "respectable"; for it seemsthat a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. Shehad never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but asuccession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort ofpallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquiredwhat may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness inher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneityallowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Herperson seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body toprovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes foreverdrooping;--a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent andbustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of heractivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace withthe honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishopimmediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid thefirst call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the generaland the prefect.The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.CHAPTER II--M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOMEThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone atthe beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theologyof the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything aboutit had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walksencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardensplanted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superbgallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on thegardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, MyLords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoinede Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, GrandPrior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton deCrillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop,Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher inordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of theseseven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorabledate, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on atable of white marble.The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with asmall garden.Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visitended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to hishouse."Monsieur the director of the hospital," said he to him, "how many sickpeople have you at the present moment?""Twenty-six, Monseigneur.""That was the number which I counted," said the Bishop."The beds," pursued the director, "are very much crowded against eachother.""That is what I observed.""The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the aircan be changed in them.""So it seems to me.""And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for theconvalescents.""That was what I said to myself.""In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; wehad the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients attimes,--we know not what to do.""That is the thought which occurred to me.""What would you have, Monseigneur?" said the director. "One must resignone's self."This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on theground-floor.The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to thedirector of the hospital."Monsieur," said he, "how many beds do you think this hall alone wouldhold?""Monseigneur's dining-room?" exclaimed the stupefied director.The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be takingmeasures and calculations with his eyes."It would hold full twenty beds," said he, as though speaking tohimself. Then, raising his voice:--"Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something.There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in fiveor six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room forsixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I haveyours. Give me back my house; you are at home here."On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in theBishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by theRevolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundredfrancs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myrielreceived from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteenthousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in thehospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once forall, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his ownhand:--NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.  For the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500 livres  Society of the  mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      100   "  For the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . .      100   "  Seminary for foreign missions in Paris  . . . . . .      200   "  Congregation of the Holy Spirit . . . . . . . . . .      150   "  Religious establishments of the Holy Land . . . . .      100   "  Charitable maternity societies  . . . . . . . . . .      300   "  Extra, for that of Arles  . . . . . . . . . . . . .       50   "  Work for the amelioration of prisons  . . . . . . .      400   "  Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners . . .      500   "  To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt  1,000   "  Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the       diocese  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    2,000   "  Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes  . . . . . . . .      100   "  Congregation of the ladies of D----, of Manosque, and of       Sisteron, for the gratuitous instruction of poor       girls  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500   "  For the poor  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    6,000   "  My personal expenses  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,000   "                                                        ------       Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15,000   "M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire periodthat he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called itregulating his household expenses.This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by MademoiselleBaptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one andthe same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to theflesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved andvenerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded heradherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. Itwill be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himselfonly one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of MademoiselleBaptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundredfrancs these two old women and the old man subsisted.And when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means toentertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and tothe intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.One day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishopsaid:--"And still I am quite cramped with it all!""I should think so!" exclaimed Madame Magloire. "Monseigneur has noteven claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expenseof his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It wascustomary for bishops in former days.""Hold!" cried the Bishop, "you are quite right, Madame Magloire."And he made his demand.Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand underconsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs,under this heading: Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage,expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senatorof the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundredwhich favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificentsenatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M.Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry andconfidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authenticlines:--"Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less thanfour thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the useof these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting beaccomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No onetravels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance andChateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus,greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when hefirst came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and aposting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the oldendays. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte,until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Downwith the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part,I am for Caesar alone." Etc., etc.On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to MadameMagloire. "Good," said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; "Monseigneurbegan with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, afterall. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousandfrancs for us! At last!"That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister amemorandum conceived in the following terms:--EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.  For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres  For the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . .   250   "  For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan  . . .   250   "  For foundlings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   "  For orphans   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   "                                                            -----       Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000   "Such was M. Myriel's budget.As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches orchapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with allthe more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those wholacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the almswhich the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop hadbecome the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all thosein distress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, butnothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode oflife, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than thereis brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it wasreceived. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money hereceived, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at thehead of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of thecountry-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, amongthe names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning forthem; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu[Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thuswhen we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleasedhim."I like that name," said he. "Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur."We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; weconfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.CHAPTER III--A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOPThe Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted hiscarriage into alms. The diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There arevery few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we havejust seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundredand eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task.The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in theneighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and ona donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When thetrip was too hard for them, he went alone.One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He wasmounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did notpermit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receivehim at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass,with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him."Monsieur the Mayor," said the Bishop, "and Messieurs Citizens, Iperceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priestto ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so fromnecessity, I assure you, and not from vanity."In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talkedrather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments andhis examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the exampleof a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to thepoor, he said: "Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred onthe poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mownthree days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses forthem gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country whichis blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a singlemurderer among them."In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: "Look atthe people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a familyhas his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service inthe town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends him tothe prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all theinhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poorman's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and hisgrain to his granary." To families divided by questions of money andinheritance he said: "Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country sowild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years.Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek theirfortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may findhusbands." To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where thefarmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: "Look at those goodpeasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls ofthem. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiffis known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts,taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, dividesinheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and heis obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men." To villages wherehe found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras: "Doyou know how they manage?" he said. "Since a little country of adozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they haveschool-masters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the roundof the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, andinstruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there.They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cordof their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teachreading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning,and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do likethe people of Queyras!"Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, heinvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases andmany images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of JesusChrist. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.CHAPTER IV--WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDSHis conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with thetwo old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed,it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him YourGrace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and wentto his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the uppershelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could notreach it. "Madame Magloire," said he, "fetch me a chair. My greatness[grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf."One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowedan opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what shedesignated as "the expectations" of her three sons. She had numerousrelatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sonswere the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from agrand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was theheir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was tosucceed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed tolisten in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. Onone occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual,while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all theseinheritances and all these "expectations." She interrupted herselfimpatiently: "Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?" "I amthinking," replied the Bishop, "of a singular remark, which is to befound, I believe, in St. Augustine,--'Place your hopes in the man fromwhom you do not inherit.'"At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of agentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of thedead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all hisrelatives, spread over an entire page: "What a stout back Death has!"he exclaimed. "What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposedon him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tombinto the service of vanity!"He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost alwaysconcealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicarcame to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent.The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to thepoor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightfulmanner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which herepresented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there wasa wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M.Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarsecloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M.Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of thatsermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor oldbeggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them toshare it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowingthis charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, "There is M.Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou."When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even bya refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks whichinduced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-roomof the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthyand avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man hasactually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, "Youmust give me something, M. le Marquis." The Marquis turned round andanswered dryly, "I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur." "Give themto me," replied the Bishop.One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:--"My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundredand twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have but threeopenings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have buttwo openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-sixthousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And thisarises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Justput poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings,and behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air tomen; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.In the department of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departmentsof the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not evenwheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they haveno candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped inpitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hillycountry of Dauphine. They make bread for six months at one time; theybake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up withan axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render iteatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides ofyou!"Born a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of thesouth. He said, "En be! moussu, ses sage?" as in lower Languedoc; "Onteanaras passa?" as in the Basses-Alpes; "Puerte un bouen moutu embe unbouen fromage grase," as in upper Dauphine. This pleased the peopleextremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to allspirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in themountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the mostvulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towardsthe lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without takingcircumstances into account. He said, "Examine the road over which thefault has passed."Being, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had noneof the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good dealof distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, adoctrine which may be summed up as follows:--"Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and histemptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it,check it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There maybe some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed isvenial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate inprayer."To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,fall, sin if you will, but be upright."The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dreamof the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is agravitation."When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry veryquickly, "Oh! oh!" he said, with a smile; "to all appearance, this isa great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisieswhich have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to putthemselves under shelter."He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden ofhuman society rest. He said, "The faults of women, of children, of thefeeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands,the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise."He said, moreover, "Teach those who are ignorant as many things aspossible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instructiongratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soulis full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not theperson who has committed the sin, but the person who has created theshadow."It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judgingthings: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on thepoint of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being atthe end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love fora woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting wasstill punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrestedin the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She washeld, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone couldaccuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; theyinsisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred tothe attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part ofthe lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunninglypresented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, andthat the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, shedenounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with hisaccomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressingenthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousyinto play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he hadeduced the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this insilence. When they had finished, he inquired,--"Where are this man and woman to be tried?""At the Court of Assizes."He went on, "And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?"A tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death formurder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactlyignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for thepublic. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of theday fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of theprison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in hislast moments. They sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come,saying, "That is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with thatunpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides,it is not my place." This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said,"Monsieur le Cure is right: it is not his place; it is mine."He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the"mountebank," called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke tohim. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep,praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying thecondemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are alsothe most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only tobless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The manwas on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As hestood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. Hewas not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. Hiscondemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, brokenthrough, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mysteryof things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond thisworld through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishopmade him see light.On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, theBishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to theeyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross uponhis neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. Thesufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, wasradiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. TheBishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall,he said to him: "God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whomhis brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe,enter into life: the Father is there." When he descended from thescaffold, there was something in his look which made the people drawaside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy ofadmiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humbledwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said tohis sister, "I have just officiated pontifically."Since the most sublime things are often those which are the leastunderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting onthis conduct of the Bishop, "It is affectation."This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, andadmired him.As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,and it was a long time before he recovered from it.In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it hassomething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certainindifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing uponit, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine withone's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent;one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admireit, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotineis the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral,and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shiverswith the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect theirinterrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is avision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is nota machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed ofwood, iron and cords.It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombreinitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, thatthis machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood,this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightfulmeditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appearsin terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. Thescaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eatsflesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricatedby the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with ahorrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the dayfollowing the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishopappeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funerealmoment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He,who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction,seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, andstammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which hissister overheard one evening and preserved: "I did not think that it wasso monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such adegree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By whatright do men touch that unknown thing?"In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoidedpassing the place of execution.M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick anddying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty andhis greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to summonhim; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down and holdhis peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of hislove, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment forsilence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! Hesought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignifyit by hope. He said:--"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Thinknot of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the livinglight of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven." He knew thatfaith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, bypointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief whichgazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon astar.CHAPTER V--MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONGThe private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as hispublic life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived,would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could haveviewed it close at hand.Like all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little.This brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for anhour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his ownhouse. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milkof his own cows. Then he set to work.A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretaryof the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day hisvicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant,a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,--prayer-books, diocesancatechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges to write, sermons toauthorize, cures and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, anadministrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other theHoly See; and a thousand matters of business.What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, andhis offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous,the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from theafflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimeshe dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one wordfor both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. "The mind is agarden," said he.Towards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took astroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. Hewas seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down,supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garmentof silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarseshoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tasselsof large bullion to droop from its three points.It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said thathis presence had something warming and luminous about it. The childrenand the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for thesun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed outhis house to any one who was in need of anything.[Illustration: The Comfortor  1b1-5-comfortor]Here and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiledupon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; whenhe no longer had any, he visited the rich.As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have itnoticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.On his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, MadameMagloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing couldbe more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of hiscures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity toserve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with somefine game from the mountains. Every cure furnished the pretext fora good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, hisordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oilsoup. Thus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge inthe cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistineand Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing,sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He wasa man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or sixvery curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse inGenesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters.With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says,The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above wasprecipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase ofOnkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face ofthe waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological worksof Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of thisbook, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributedthe divers little works published during the last century, under thepseudonym of Barleycourt.Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book mightbe which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profoundmeditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages ofthe volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever withthe book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note writtenby him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germainwith Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the Americanstation. Versailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot,bookseller, Quai des Augustins.Here is the note:--"Oh, you who are!"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you theCreator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch callsyou Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls youLight; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence;Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; mancalls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the mostbeautiful of all your names."Toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betookthemselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone untilmorning on the ground floor.It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of thedwelling of the Bishop of D----CHAPTER VI--WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIMThe house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a groundfloor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, threechambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was agarden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied thefirst floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on thestreet, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and thethird his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, exceptby passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passingthrough the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, therewas a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality.The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or therequirements of their parishes brought to D----The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been addedto the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed intoa kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden astable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and inwhich the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk theygave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people inthe hospital. "I am paying my tithes," he said.His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in badweather. As wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea ofhaving a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here hepassed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it hiswinter salon.In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no otherfurniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seatedchairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with anantique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similarsideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, theBishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than onceassessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur'soratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it tothe poor. "The most beautiful of altars," he said, "is the soul of anunhappy creature consoled and thanking God."In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was anarm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he receivedseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or thestaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the littleseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in thestable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from thebedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for thevisitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishopthen relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in frontof the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it wassummer.There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw washalf gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of serviceonly when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also inher own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly beengilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had beenobliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window,as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckonedamong the possibilities in the way of furniture.Mademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase a setof drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rosepattern, and with mahogany in swan's neck style, with a sofa. But thiswould have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the factthat she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous forthis purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncingthe idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop'sbedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was thebed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in theshadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: therewere two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; theother near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase wasa large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was ofwood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In thechimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with twogarlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silveredwith silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above thechimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixedon a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which thegilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand,loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before thetable an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowedfrom the oratory.Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side ofthe bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth atthe side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented,one the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the AbbeTourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux,diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, afterthe hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had leftthem. They were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respectingthem. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they hadbeen appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to hisbenefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloirehaving taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered theseparticulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowedby time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe ofGrand-Champ with four wafers.At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, whichfinally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one,Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middleof it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often calledattention to it: "How delightful that is!" he said.All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the groundfloor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is afashion in barracks and hospitals.However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath thepaper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartmentof Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becominga hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of theBourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks,which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, wasexquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which theBishop permitted. He said, "That takes nothing from the poor."It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his formerpossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, whichMadame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistenedsplendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now paintingthe Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had saidmore than once, "I find it difficult to renounce eating from silverdishes."To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massivesilver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticksheld two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece.When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candlesand set the candlesticks on the table.In the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a smallcupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives andforks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, thatthe key was never removed.The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings whichwe have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiatingfrom a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirtedthe white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them foursquare plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloirecultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted someflowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire hadonce remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: "Monseigneur, you who turneverything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would bebetter to grow salads there than bouquets." "Madame Magloire," retortedthe Bishop, "you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as theuseful." He added after a pause, "More so, perhaps."This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishopalmost as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, intowhich he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardenercould have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions tobotany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightesteffort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took partneither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu againstLinnaeus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respectedlearned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, withoutever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds everysummer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of thedining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedralsquare, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the doorof a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this doorwas never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except thelatch. All that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give ita push. At first, the two women had been very much tried by this door,which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, "Havebolts put on your rooms, if that will please you." They had ended bysharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the Bishop,his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the threelines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, "This is the shade ofdifference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the door ofthe priest should always be open."On another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he hadwritten this other note: "Am not I a physician like them? I also have mypatients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates."Again he wrote: "Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter ofyou. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needsshelter."It chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure ofCouloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to askhim one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whetherMonsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to acertain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at themercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short,he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so littleguarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, andsaid to him, "Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant quicustodiunt eam," Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watchwho guard it.Then he spoke of something else.He was fond of saying, "There is a bravery of the priest as well asthe bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only," he added, "ours must betranquil."CHAPTER VII--CRAVATTEIt is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must notomit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of aman the Bishop of D---- was.After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested thegorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge inthe mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, theremnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made hisway to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinityof Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hidhimself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, and thence he descendedtowards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye andUbayette.He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night,and despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste thecountry-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. Healways escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a boldwretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He wasmaking his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urgedhim to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountainsas far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; itmerely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose."Therefore," said the Bishop, "I intend to go without escort.""You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!" exclaimed the mayor."I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, andshall set out in an hour.""Set out?""Set out.""Alone?""Alone.""Monseigneur, you will not do that!""There exists yonder in the mountains," said the Bishop, "a tinycommunity no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years.They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They ownone goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very prettywoollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs onlittle flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God nowand then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What wouldthey say if I did not go?""But the brigands, Monseigneur?""Hold," said the Bishop, "I must think of that. You are right. I maymeet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God.""But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!""Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolvesthat Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways ofProvidence?""They will rob you, Monseigneur.""I have nothing.""They will kill you.""An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!To what purpose?""Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!""I should beg alms of them for my poor.""Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking yourlife!""Monsieur le maire," said the Bishop, "is that really all? I am not inthe world to guard my own life, but to guard souls."They had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied onlyby a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruitedabout the country-side, and caused great consternation.He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed themountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and soundat the residence of his "good friends," the shepherds. He remainedthere for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching,exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he resolved tochant a Te Deum pontifically. He mentioned it to the cure. But what wasto be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place athis disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasublesof threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace."Bah!" said the Bishop. "Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit,nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure. Things will arrange themselves."They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All themagnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficedto clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought anddeposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, whodeparted on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope ofcloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross,a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had beenstolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. Inthe chest was a paper, on which these words were written, "From Cravatteto Monseigneur Bienvenu.""Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?" said theBishop. Then he added, with a smile, "To him who contents himself withthe surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.""Monseigneur," murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile."God--or the Devil."The Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority,"God!"When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as ata curiosity, all along the road. At the priest's house in Chastelar herejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waitingfor him, and he said to his sister: "Well! was I in the right? The poorpriest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returnsfrom them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; Ihave brought back the treasure of a cathedral."That evening, before he went to bed, he said again: "Let us never fearrobbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers.Let us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are thereal murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters itwhat threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that whichthreatens our soul."Then, turning to his sister: "Sister, never a precaution on the partof the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, Godpermits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a dangeris approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brothermay not fall into sin on our account."However, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of whichwe know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things atthe same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.As to what became of "the treasure" of the cathedral of Embrun, weshould be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted ofvery handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were verywell adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolenthey had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; itonly remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause itto take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make noassertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found amongthe Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, andwhich is couched in these terms, "The question is, to decide whetherthis should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital."CHAPTER VIII--PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKINGThe senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way,heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are calledconscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to hisgoal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and hisinterest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man byany means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons,his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wiselyseized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls.Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, and justsufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while hewas, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willinglyand pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the "Crotchetsof that good old fellow the Bishop." He even sometimes laughed at himwith an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, wholistened to him.On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what,Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect.At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though stillperfectly dignified, exclaimed:--"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and abishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I amgoing to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own.""And you are right," replied the Bishop. "As one makes one's philosophy,so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator."The senator was encouraged, and went on:--"Let us be good fellows.""Good devils even," said the Bishop."I declare to you," continued the senator, "that the Marquis d'Argens,Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all thephilosophers in my library gilded on the edges.""Like yourself, Count," interposed the Bishop.The senator resumed:--"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist,a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltairemade sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove thatGod is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste suppliesthe fiat lux. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger;you have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the EternalFather? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothingbut to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down with thatgreat All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace!Between you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confessionto my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that Ihave good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preachesrenunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. 'Tis the counsel of anavaricious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end?I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of anotherwolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let us have asuperior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the top, ifone sees no further than the end of other people's noses? Let us livemerrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on high,below, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it. Ah!sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed toeverything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over thejust and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas. Why? Because I shallhave to render an account of my actions. When? After death. What a finedream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me.Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tellthe truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis:there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let us go into itthoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! We must scentout the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then it gives youexquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh. I am square on thebottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men'sshoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What afine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wingson our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullianwho says that the blessed shall travel from star to star? Very well. Weshall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shallsee God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God is anonsensical monster. I would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but Imay whisper it among friends. Inter pocula. To sacrifice the world toparadise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of theinfinite! I'm not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur leComte Nought, senator. Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I existafter death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. Whatam I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall havesuffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shallhave enjoyed myself. My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten. Ishall eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is mywisdom. After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there;the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole. End. Finis.Total liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believeme. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tellme on that subject. Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah formen. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb there is nothingbut equal nothingness. You have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincentde Paul--it makes no difference. That is the truth. Then live your life,above all things. Make use of your _I_ while you have it. In truth,Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have myphilosophers. I don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.Of course, there must be something for those who are down,--for thebarefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends,chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided forthem to swallow. They gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread.He who has nothing else has the good. God. That is the least he canhave. I oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon formyself. The good God is good for the populace."The Bishop clapped his hands."That's talking!" he exclaimed. "What an excellent and really marvellousthing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah!when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidlyallow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, norburned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuringthis admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselvesirresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything withoutuneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well orill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savorycapitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb withtheir digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say thatwith reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for meto refrain from congratulating you. You great lords have, so you say, aphilosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined,accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasonsthe voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has beenextracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you aregood-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief inthe good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very muchas the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor."CHAPTER IX--THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTERIn order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of theBishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted womensubordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instinctseven, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of theBishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order toexplain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letterfrom Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, thefriend of her childhood. This letter is in our possession.                                        D----, Dec. 16, 18--.MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking of you. It is ourestablished custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine,while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire hasmade some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paperwhitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use forspreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height,eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded,and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while thiswas the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.But my room is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered,under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings,which without being good are very tolerable. The subject is Telemachusbeing knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapesme. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. Whatshall I say to you? I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs anillegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it alloff; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, andthe whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum. She hasalso found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancientfashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, butit is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very uglybesides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has tothe poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying inthe winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these aregreat treats.My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishopought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. Hefears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposeshimself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us evenseem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. Hefears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He wouldnot take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing hadhappened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, andsaid, "This is the way I have been robbed!" And then he opened a trunkfull of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which thethieves had given him.When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding hima little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriagewas making a noise, so that no one might hear me.At first I used to say to myself, "There are no dangers which will stophim; he is terrible." Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make asign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himselfas he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I prayfor him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anythingwere to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to thegood God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloiremore trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms hisimprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, wetremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter thishouse, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for usto fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is strongerthan we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word tome. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves tothe care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man whopossesses grandeur of soul.I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which youdesire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knowseverything, and that he has memories, because he is still a verygood royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of thegeneralship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, aJean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whomwas a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and wascommander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son ofthe Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards,and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, andFaoucq.Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative,Monsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well innot wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.She is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.That is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through youreached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so verybad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end,and this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes.BAPTISTINE.P.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon befive years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback whohad on knee-caps, and he said, "What has he got on his knees?" He is acharming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about theroom, like a carriage, and saying, "Hu!"As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how tomould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine geniuswhich comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishopof D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never desertedhim, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent,without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, butthey let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance inadvance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interferedwith him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.At certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when hewas not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect washis simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; thenthey were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served himpassively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared.They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certaincares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to bein peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature,to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided himto God.Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's endwould prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.CHAPTER X--THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHTAt an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in thepreceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to bebelieved, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountainsinfested with bandits.In the country near D---- a man lived quite alone. This man, we willstate at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----Member of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror inthe little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imaginesuch a thing? That existed from the time when people called each otherthou, and when they said "citizen." This man was almost a monster.He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was aquasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that sucha man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return ofthe legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if youplease; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment forlife. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like allthe rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.Was G---- a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by theelement of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for thedeath of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, andhad been able to remain in France.He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, farfrom any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wildvalley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sortof field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by.Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither haddisappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of asthough it had been the dwelling of a hangman.Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to timehe gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked thevalley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, "There is asoul yonder which is lonely."And he added, deep in his own mind, "I owe him a visit."But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush,appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, andalmost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, andthe old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearlyconscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders onhate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No.But what a sheep!The good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction;then he returned.Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of youngshepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had comein quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis wasgaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--"Thank God!"some added.The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his toothreadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the eveningbreeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishoparrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart,he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over aditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs,entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal ofboldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behindlofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailedagainst the outside.Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants,there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offeringthe old man a jar of milk.While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: "Thank you," hesaid, "I need nothing." And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon thechild.The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, theold man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of thesurprise which a man can still feel after a long life."This is the first time since I have been here," said he, "that any onehas entered here. Who are you, sir?"The Bishop answered:--"My name is Bienvenu Myriel.""Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom thepeople call Monseigneur Welcome?""I am."The old man resumed with a half-smile"In that case, you are my bishop?""Something of that sort.""Enter, sir."The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but theBishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:--"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do notseem to me to be ill.""Monsieur," replied the old man, "I am going to recover."He paused, and then said:--"I shall die three hours hence."Then he continued:--"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour drawson. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended tomy knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart,I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeledout here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does notfatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is onthe point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at thatmoment. One has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until thedawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be nightthen. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One hasno need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight."The old man turned to the shepherd lad:--"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired."The child entered the hut.The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking tohimself:--"I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors."The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. Hedid not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say thewhole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicatedlike the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at "HisGrace," was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and hewas almost tempted to retort "citizen." He was assailed by a fancy forpeevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but whichwas not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of theConvention, this representative of the people, had been one of thepowerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably,the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with amodest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, thathumility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning todust.The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity,which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain fromexamining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as itdid not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience asa matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of theConvention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the paleof the law, even of the law of charity. G----, calm, his body almostupright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who formthe subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution hadmany of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one wasconscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, hepreserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firmtone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was somethingcalculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of thesepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistakenthe door. G---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so. There wasfreedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was there thatthe shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his headsurvived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G----,at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient whowas flesh above and marble below.There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt."I congratulate you," said he, in the tone which one uses for areprimand. "You did not vote for the death of the king, after all."The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bittermeaning underlying the words "after all." He replied. The smile hadquite disappeared from his face."Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of thetyrant."It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity."What do you mean to say?" resumed the Bishop."I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance. I voted for the deathof that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authorityfalsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Manshould be governed only by science.""And conscience," added the Bishop."It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate sciencewhich we have within us."Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language,which was very new to him.The member of the Convention resumed:--"So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said 'no.' I did not think that Ihad the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil.I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitutionfor woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child.In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity,concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices anderrors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. Wehave caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase ofmiseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urnof joy.""Mixed joy," said the Bishop."You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of thepast, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The workwas incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; wewere not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is notsufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; thewind is still there.""You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust ademolition complicated with wrath.""Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element ofprogress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the FrenchRevolution is the most important step of the human race since the adventof Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all theunknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased,enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over theearth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration ofhumanity."The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:--"Yes? '93!"The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair withan almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man iscapable of exclamation:--"Ah, there you go; '93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had beenforming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteenhundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial."The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something withinhim had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on thematter. He replied:--"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the nameof pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt shouldcommit no error." And he added, regarding the member of the Conventionsteadily the while, "Louis XVII.?"The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm."Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocentchild? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royalchild? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche,an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve,until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brotherof Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., aninnocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crimeof having been grandson of Louis XV.""Monsieur," said the Bishop, "I like not this conjunction of names.""Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?"A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, andyet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.The conventionary resumed:--"Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christloved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge,full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried,'Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children.It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin ofBarabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its owncrown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in ragsas in fleurs de lys.""That is true," said the Bishop in a low voice."I persist," continued the conventionary G---- "You have mentioned LouisXVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all theinnocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?I agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go backfurther than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I willweep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weepwith me over the children of the people.""I weep for all," said the Bishop."Equally!" exclaimed conventionary G----; "and if the balance mustincline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been sufferinglonger."Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. Heraised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumband his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates andjudges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces ofthe death agony. It was almost an explosion."Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! thatis not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to meabout Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these partsI have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, andseeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me ina confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit;but that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of imposing onthat honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound ofyour carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the forkof the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told methat you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to yourmoral personality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You area bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gildedmen with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,--thebishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousandin perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,--who have kitchens,who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, whostrut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, andwho have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of JesusChrist who went barefoot! You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses,servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this likethe rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this sayseither too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon theintrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probableintention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? Who are you?"The Bishop hung his head and replied, "Vermis sum--I am a worm.""A worm of the earth in a carriage?" growled the conventionary.It was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to behumble.The Bishop resumed mildly:--"So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few pacesoff behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which Ieat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palaceand my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that '93 was notinexorable."The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweepaway a cloud."Before replying to you," he said, "I beseech you to pardon me. I havejust committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, Iowe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confinemyself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures areadvantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictatesthat I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of themin the future.""I thank you," said the Bishop.G---- resumed."Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where werewe? What were you saying to me? That '93 was inexorable?""Inexorable; yes," said the Bishop. "What think you of Marat clappinghis hands at the guillotine?""What think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?"The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directnessof a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred tohim; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The bestof minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguelywounded by the want of respect of logic.The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which ismingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was aperfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:--"Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense humanaffirmation, '93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir;but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what namedo you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but whatis your opinion as to Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; butSaulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchene senior is ferocious; but whatepithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Teteis a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir,sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I amalso sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis theGreat, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist,to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled withmilk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheldthat breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, amother and a nurse, 'Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death ofher infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that tortureof Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: theFrench Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will beabsolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From itsmost terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race. Iabridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying."And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded histhoughts in these tranquil words:--"Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they areover, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treatedharshly, but that it has progressed."The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all theinmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from thisintrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance,came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of thebeginning:--"Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor.He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race."The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seizedwith a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance atear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled downhis livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and tohimself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:--"O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!"The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:--"The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, personwould be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, itwould not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite isGod."The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and withthe shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken,his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that hehad just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left tohim. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death.The supreme moment was approaching.The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he hadcome: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion;he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-coldhand in his, and bent over the dying man."This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would beregrettable if we had met in vain?"The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloomwas imprinted on his countenance."Bishop," said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from hisdignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, "I have passed mylife in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of agewhen my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with itsaffairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed,I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed andconfessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France wasmenaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have been oneof the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumberedwith specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls,which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold andsilver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succoredthe oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth fromthe altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. Ihave always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towardsthe light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have,when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of yourprofession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spotwhere the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent ofUrbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the goodthat I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted,blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past,I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think theyhave the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present thevisage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of hatred, withouthating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I am on the pointof death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?""Your blessing," said the Bishop.And he knelt down.When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary hadbecome august. He had just expired.The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannotbe known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the followingmorning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him aboutmember of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointingheavenward.From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feelingtowards all children and sufferers.Any allusion to "that old wretch of a G----" caused him to fall into asingular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soulbefore his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, didnot count for something in his approach to perfection.This "pastoral visit" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur ofcomment in all the little local coteries."Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for abishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All thoserevolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to beseen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carriedoff by the devil."One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herselfspiritual, addressed this sally to him, "Monseigneur, people areinquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!"--"Oh! oh!that's a coarse color," replied the Bishop. "It is lucky that those whodespise it in a cap revere it in a hat."CHAPTER XI--A RESTRICTIONWe should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to concludefrom this that Monseigneur Welcome was "a philosophical bishop," or a"patriotic cure." His meeting, which may almost be designated as hisunion, with conventionary G----, left behind it in his mind a sort ofastonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is,perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in theevents of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamedof having an attitude.Let us, then, go back a few years.Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, theEmperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many otherbishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on thenight of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myrielwas summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italyconvened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembledfor the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidencyof Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops whoattended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at three or fourprivate conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very closeto nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he importedamong these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature ofthe assembly. He very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as tothis speedy return, and he replied: "I embarrassed them. The outside airpenetrated to them through me. I produced on them the effect of an opendoor."On another occasion he said, "What would you have? Those gentlemen areprinces. I am only a poor peasant bishop."The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it issaid that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself atthe house of one of his most notable colleagues: "What beautiful clocks!What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a greattrouble. I would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantlyin my ears: 'There are people who are hungry! There are people who arecold! There are poor people! There are poor people!'"Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not anintelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection withrepresentations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which havevery little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is acontradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one comein contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all thesemisfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one's own person alittle of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imaginea man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who isworking near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackenednails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The firstproof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought.It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the "ideasof the century" on certain delicate points. He took very little partin the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence onquestions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he hadbeen strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be anultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, andsince we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that hewas glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, hegave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. Herefused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the islandof Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperorin his diocese during the Hundred Days.Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one ageneral, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a commandin Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the generalhad put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued theEmperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirousof allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, theex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, RueCassette, remained more affectionate.Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hourof bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the momenttraversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things.Certainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain anypolitical opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we arenot confounding what is called "political opinions" with the grandaspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic,humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generousintellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only indirectlyconnected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: Itwould have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist,and if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away fromthat serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above thefictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes ofhuman things, the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice,and charity.While admitting that it was not for a political office that God createdMonseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protestin the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just butperilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleasesus in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people whoare falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and inany case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to bethe exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser inprosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator ofsuccess is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, whenProvidence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced todisarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturnlegislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits whicharoused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in thepresence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senatewhich passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after havingdeified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footingand spitting on its idol,--it was a duty to turn aside the head. In1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seizedwith a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimlydiscerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the armyand the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it,and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that ofthe Bishop of D----, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize theaugust and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nationand a great man on the brink of the abyss.With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable,intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is onlyanother sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It mustbe admitted, that even in the political views with which we have justreproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity,he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speakinghere. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor.He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of theLegion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle.This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which thelaw then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the imperial profiledisappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in hisregimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear hiscross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from thecross which Napoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would notput anything in its place. "I will die," he said, "rather than wear thethree frogs upon my heart!" He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. "Thegouty old creature in English gaiters!" he said; "let him take himselfoff to Prussia with that queue of his." He was happy to combine in thesame imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia andEngland. He did it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turnedout of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread. TheBishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him beadle inthe cathedral.In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holydeeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D----with a sort oftender and filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had beenaccepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good andweakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.CHAPTER XII--THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOMEA bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes,just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is whatthat charming Saint Francois de Sales calls somewhere "les pretresblancs-becs," callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who forma train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no powerwhich has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not itscourt. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Everymetropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses theleast influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary,which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace,and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile. To please a bishop isequivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate.It is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does notdisdain the canonship.Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church.These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, wellendowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt,but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a wholediocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting linksbetween the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests,prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Beingpersons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon theassiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understandthe art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates,chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. Asthey advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also;it is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleamof purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behindthe scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese of thepatron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome.A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop whoknows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist;you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, andbehold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor,and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminenceand the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap maydream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become aking in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what anursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers,how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk!Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in goodfaith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted amongthe big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of youngpriests about him. We have seen that he "did not take" in Paris. Not asingle future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth itsfoliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men,rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, withoutexit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with thisdifference, that they were finished and he was completed. Theimpossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so wellunderstood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left theseminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aixor of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it,men wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegationis a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion,an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful inadvancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; andthis infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of MonseigneurBienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is thelesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its falseresemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almostthe same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menaechmus of talent, hasone dupe,--history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In ourday, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into itsservice, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of itsantechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in thelottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated.Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that. Belucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will thinkyou great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which composethe splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing butshort-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the firstarrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive. The common herd is anold Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.That enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante,Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and byacclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it mayconsist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a falseCorneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let amilitary Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch;let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of theSambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, soldas leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packerespouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, ofwhich he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacherbecome a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a finefamily be so rich on retiring from service that he is made ministerof finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the faceof Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty. With theconstellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which aremade in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.CHAPTER XIII--WHAT HE BELIEVEDWe are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score oforthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no moodbut respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on hisword. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possibledevelopment of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differsfrom our own.What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets ofthe inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, wheresouls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that thedifficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in hiscase. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extentof his powers. "Credo in Patrem," he often exclaimed. Moreover, hedrew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to theconscience, and which whispers to a man, "Thou art with God!"The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of andbeyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. Itwas in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved much--thathe was regarded as vulnerable by "serious men," "grave persons" and"reasonable people"; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotismtakes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love?It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have alreadypointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things. He livedwithout disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation. Every man,even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reservesfor animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which ispeculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as theBrahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: "Whoknoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?" Hideousness of aspect,deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse hisindignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed asthough he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life whichis apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. Heseemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examinedwithout wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering apalimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. Thisrevery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was inhis garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behindhim, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on theground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heardhim say:--"Poor beast! It is not its fault!"Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar toSaint Francis d'Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained hisankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this justman. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothingmore venerable possible.Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth,and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate,and, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinctof nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered intohis heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly,thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may existapertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; theseformations are indestructible.In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifthbirthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall;he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fondof taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form wasbut slightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw anyconclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect andsmiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. MonseigneurWelcome had what the people term a "fine head," but so amiable was hethat they forgot that it was fine.When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of hischarms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their easewith him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh andruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved,and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy airwhich cause the remark to be made of a man, "He's a good fellow"; andof an old man, "He is a fine man." That, it will be recalled, was theeffect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and toone who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fineman. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in theleast degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, andtook on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and seriousbrow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtueof meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodnessceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion whichone would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings,without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect, penetratedyou by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one hadbefore him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent soulswhere thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion,alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bitof land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence,study, work, filled every day of his life. Filled is exactly the word;certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words andgood deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weatherprevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed,and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite withhim, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence ofthe grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two oldwomen were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks ata very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing withhimself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with theserenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendorof the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening hisheart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments,while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offertheir perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as hepoured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance ofcreation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing inhis spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and somethingdescend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul withthe abysses of the universe!He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity,that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still morestrange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into allhis senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend theincomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was dazzledby him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, whichcommunicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, createindividualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in theinfinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions areformed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepitvine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettesof his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, soencumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfiedhis wants.What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of hislife, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in thedaytime and contemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, withthe heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in hismost divine works, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? andwhat is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which towalk, and immensity in which to dream. At one's feet that which can becultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditateupon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.CHAPTER XIV--WHAT HE THOUGHTOne last word.Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment,and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- acertain "pantheistical" physiognomy, and induce the belief, eitherto his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personalphilosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes springup in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until theyusurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one ofthose persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himselfauthorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened thisman was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes fromthere.No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no,there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. Theapostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probablyhave felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problemswhich are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds. There is asacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openingsstand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life,that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation,situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas toGod. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adorationinterrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of anxiety andresponsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzesand digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that bya sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysteriousworld which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it isprobable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be,there are on earth men who--are they men?--perceive distinctly at theverge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute, and whohave the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcomewas one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He wouldhave feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, likeSwedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, thesepowerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous pathsone approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path whichshortens,--the Gospel's.He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah'smantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell ofevents; he did not seek to condense in flame the light of things; hehad nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. Thishumble soul loved, and that was all.That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration isprobable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and SaintJerome would be heretics.He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universeappeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking tosolve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacleof created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied onlyin finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way tocompassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rarepriest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extractionof pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reignedeverywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. Love each other; hedeclared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was thewhole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be a"philosopher," the senator who has already been alluded to, said to theBishop: "Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war againstall; the strongest has the most wit. Your love each other isnonsense."--"Well," replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting thepoint, "if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as thepearl in the oyster." Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, hewas absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigiousquestions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives ofabstraction, the precipices of metaphysics--all those profunditieswhich converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscienceof man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformationin death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, theincomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_,the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature,liberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, wherelean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses,which Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyesflashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite tocause stars to blaze forth there.Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior ofmysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troublinghis own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a graverespect for darkness.BOOK SECOND--THE FALLCHAPTER I--THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKINGEarly in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, aman who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D----The fewinhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at themoment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It wasdifficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He wasa man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with adrooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned bysun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellowlinen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a viewof his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers ofblue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on theother; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows witha bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldierknapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous,knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; ashaved head and a long beard.The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know notwhat sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut,yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem tohave been cut for some time.No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence camehe? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entranceinto D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, hadwitnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannesto Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very muchfatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated belowthe city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi,and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. Hemust have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw himstop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain inthe market-place.On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came outa quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on thestone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to readto the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- the proclamationof the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted thegendarme.The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him,followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.There then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross ofColbas. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a manof consideration in the town on account of his relationship to anotherLabarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and hadserved in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumorshad circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of theThree Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as acarter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, andthat he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfulsof gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor enteredGrenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of theprefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, "I am going to the houseof a brave man of my acquaintance"; and he had betaken himself to theThree Dauphins. This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins wasreflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of fiveand twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, "That is the cousinof the man of Grenoble."The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in thecountry-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with thestreet. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in thefireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from onestew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinnerdesigned for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, andlaughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who hastravelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer thanwagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks,was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carpsfrom Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said,without raising his eyes from his stoves:--"What do you wish, sir?""Food and lodging," said the man."Nothing easier," replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, "Bypaying for it."The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, andanswered, "I have money.""In that case, we are at your service," said the host.The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack fromhis back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in hishand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is inthe mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller."Will dinner be ready soon?" said the man."Immediately," replied the landlord.While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his backturned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket,then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a smalltable near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two,folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper toa child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion andlackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, and thechild set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.The traveller saw nothing of all this.Once more he inquired, "Will dinner be ready soon?""Immediately," responded the host.The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded iteagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read itattentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared tobe immersed in reflections which were not very serene."I cannot receive you, sir," said he.The man half rose."What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay youin advance? I have money, I tell you.""It is not that.""What then?""You have money--""Yes," said the man."And I," said the host, "have no room."The man resumed tranquilly, "Put me in the stable.""I cannot.""Why?""The horses take up all the space.""Very well!" retorted the man; "a corner of the loft then, a truss ofstraw. We will see about that after dinner.""I cannot give you any dinner."This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the strangeras grave. He rose."Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. Ihave travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat.""I have nothing," said the landlord.The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and thestoves: "Nothing! and all that?""All that is engaged.""By whom?""By messieurs the wagoners.""How many are there of them?""Twelve.""There is enough food there for twenty.""They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance."The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, "I amat an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain."Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made himstart, "Go away!"At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting somebrands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turnedquickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazedsteadily at him and added, still in a low voice: "Stop! there's enoughof that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name isJean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw youcome in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was thereply that was sent to me. Can you read?"So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper whichhad just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hallto the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after apause."I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!"The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had depositedon the ground, and took his departure.He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture,keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did notturn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the hostof the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by allthe guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talkingvivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glancesof terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that hisarrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behindthem. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversingat random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue,as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangsof hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to seewhether he could not discover some shelter.The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humblepublic house, some hovel, however lowly.Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branchsuspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white skyof the twilight. He proceeded thither.It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is inthe Rue de Chaffaut.The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into theinterior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by asmall lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men wereengaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An ironpot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is bytwo doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filledwith manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slippedinto the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and openedthe door."Who goes there?" said the master."Some one who wants supper and bed.""Good. We furnish supper and bed here."He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lampilluminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examinedhim for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.The host said to him, "There is the fire. The supper is cooking in thepot. Come and warm yourself, comrade."He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out hisfeet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor wasemitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneathhis cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearanceof comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitualsuffering bestows.It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. Thisphysiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, andended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a firebeneath brushwood.One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who,before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been tostable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morningencountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Brasd'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now,when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, hadrequested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger hadmade no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had beena member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded JacquinLabarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of themorning to the people at the Cross of Colbas. From where he sat he madean imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went tohim. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again becomeabsorbed in his reflections.The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly onthe shoulder of the man, and said to him:--"You are going to get out of here."The stranger turned round and replied gently, "Ah! You know?--""Yes.""I was sent away from the other inn.""And you are to be turned out of this one.""Where would you have me go?""Elsewhere."The man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.As he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross ofColbas, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at him.He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick: thechildren dispersed like a flock of birds.He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached toa bell. He rang.The wicket opened."Turnkey," said he, removing his cap politely, "will you have thekindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?"A voice replied:--"The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will beadmitted."The wicket closed again.He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some ofthem are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to thestreet. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of asmall house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. Hepeered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was alarge whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, anda cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gunhanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. Acopper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewterjug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smokingsoup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry andopen countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close bya very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing,the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.The stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calmingspectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could havetold. It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would behospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, hewould find perhaps a little pity.He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.They did not hear him.He tapped again.He heard the woman say, "It seems to me, husband, that some one isknocking.""No," replied the husband.He tapped a third time.The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore ahuge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which ahammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objectswhich were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. Hecarried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and turnedback, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick eyelashes,enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his facelike a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his own ground,which is indescribable."Pardon me, sir," said the wayfarer, "Could you, in consideration ofpayment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in thegarden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?""Who are you?" demanded the master of the house.The man replied: "I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked allday long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?--if I pay?""I would not refuse," said the peasant, "to lodge any respectable manwho would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?""There is no room.""Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you beento Labarre?""Yes.""Well?"The traveller replied with embarrassment: "I do not know. He did notreceive me.""Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?"The stranger's embarrassment increased; he stammered, "He did notreceive me either."The peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyedthe newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort ofshudder:--"Are you the man?--"He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.Meanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, hadclasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitatelybehind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosomuncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone,"Tso-maraude."[1]All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it toone's self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as onescrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door andsaid:--"Clear out!""For pity's sake, a glass of water," said the man."A shot from my gun!" said the peasant.Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two largebolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of abar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By thelight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardenswhich bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to bebuilt of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and foundhimself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of avery low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings whichroad-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thoughtwithout doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; hewas suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelterfrom the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warmthere, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment,stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, sofatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, andas it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he set aboutunbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious growl becameaudible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog was outlined inthe darkness at the entrance of the hut.It was a dog's kennel.He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff,made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in thebest way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged,in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manoeuvrewith his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as larose couverte.When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and foundhimself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter,without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw andfrom that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on astone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, "I am not evena dog!"He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town,hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would affordhim shelter.He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felthimself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazedsearchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of thoselow hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest,resemble shaved heads.The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity ofnight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to restupon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the wholesky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was stillfloating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, theseclouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence agleam of light fell upon the earth.The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces aparticularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor andmean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The wholeeffect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits ofintelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysteriousaspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky,in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundlydesolate, that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned backabruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.He retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed. D----, which hadsustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surroundedin 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have beendemolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town again.It might have been eight o'clock in the evening. As he was notacquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As hepassed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It isthere that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guardto the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleonhimself, were printed for the first time.Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay downon a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the manstretched out in the shadow. "What are you doing there, my friend?" saidshe.He answered harshly and angrily: "As you see, my good woman, I amsleeping." The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, wasthe Marquise de R----"On this bench?" she went on."I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years," said the man;"to-day I have a mattress of stone.""You have been a soldier?""Yes, my good woman, a soldier.""Why do you not go to the inn?""Because I have no money.""Alas!" said Madame de R----, "I have only four sous in my purse.""Give it to me all the same."The man took the four sous. Madame de R---- continued: "You cannotobtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It isimpossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, nodoubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.""I have knocked at all doors.""Well?""I have been driven away everywhere."The "good woman" touched the man's arm, and pointed out to him on theother side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside theBishop's palace."You have knocked at all doors?""Yes.""Have you knocked at that one?""No.""Knock there."CHAPTER II--PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.That evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town,remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great workon Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefullycompiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on thisimportant subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, theduties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to theclass to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. Thereare four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God(Matt. vi.); duties towards one's self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towardsone's neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties towards animals (Matt. vi. 20,25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them pointed out andprescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the Epistle to theRomans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by SaintPeter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistleto the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; tovirgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these precepts he waslaboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he desired to presentto souls.At eight o'clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal ofinconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on hisknees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get thesilver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probablywaiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered thedining-room.The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had adoor opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening onthe garden.Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to thetable.As she performed this service, she was conversing with MademoiselleBaptistine.A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood firewas burning there.One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whomwere over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than herbrother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806,which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lastedever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of givingutterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardlysuffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, andMademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a whitequilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck,the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a verywhite fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, withlarge, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks,knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of thesame attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on herfeet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. MademoiselleBaptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist,a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons.She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig.Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the twocorners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which waslarger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperiouslook. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to himresolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as soon asMonseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed passively likeher mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak. She confinedherself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been pretty, evenwhen she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a longarched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth anineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. She had always beenpredestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, those three virtueswhich mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that gentleness tosanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her an angel.Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at theepiscopal residence that evening, that there are many people now livingwho still recall the most minute details.At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking withconsiderable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine ona subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was alsoaccustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, MadameMagloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of aprowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who mustbe somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into theirheads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasantencounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because therewas no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injureeach other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play thepart of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must betaken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to fasten thedoors well.Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had justcome from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in frontof the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of otherthings. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by MadameMagloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, desirous ofsatisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured tosay timidly:--"Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?""I have heard something of it in a vague way," replied the Bishop. Thenhalf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raisingtowards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grewjoyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,--"Come,what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?"Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it alittle without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, abare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that momentin the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre's to obtainlodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He hadbeen seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam aboutthe streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face."Really!" said the Bishop.This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemedto her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed;she pursued triumphantly:--"Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort ofcatastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, thepolice is so badly regulated" (a useful repetition). "The idea of livingin a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets atnight! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, andMademoiselle there says with me--""I," interrupted his sister, "say nothing. What my brother does is welldone."Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:--"We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur willpermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come andreplace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only thework of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than adoor which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the firstpasser-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for thisnight; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying 'come in';and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is noneed to ask permission."At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door."Come in," said the Bishop.CHAPTER III--THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.The door opened.It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it anenergetic and resolute push.A man entered.We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wanderingabout in search of shelter.He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behindhim. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, arough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire onthe hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition.Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,and stood with her mouth wide open.Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and halfstarted up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards thefireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face becameonce more profoundly calm and serene.The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired,the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old manand the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said,in a loud voice:--"See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys.I have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four daysago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I havebeen walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a dozenleagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, Iwent to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport,which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn.They said to me, 'Be off,' at both places. No one would take me. Iwent to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog'skennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man.One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields,intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were nostars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, toseek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleepon a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me, and saidto me, 'Knock there!' I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keepan inn? I have money--savings. One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous,which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteenyears. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary;twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing that I shouldremain?""Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will set another place."The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was onthe table. "Stop," he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;"that's not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I comefrom the galleys." He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellowpaper, which he unfolded. "Here's my passport. Yellow, as you see. Thisserves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I knowhow to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for thosewho choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: 'JeanValjean, discharged convict, native of'--that is nothing to you--'hasbeen nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breakingand burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on fouroccasions. He is a very dangerous man.' There! Every one has cast meout. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give mesomething to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?""Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will put white sheets on thebed in the alcove." We have already explained the character of the twowomen's obedience.Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.The Bishop turned to the man."Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few moments,and your bed will be prepared while you are supping."At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face,up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction,of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like acrazy man:--"Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict!You call me sir! You do not address me as thou? 'Get out of here, youdog!' is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would expelme, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that was whodirected me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and sheets,like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since I haveslept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are goodpeople. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur theinn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you ask. You area fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?""I am," replied the Bishop, "a priest who lives here.""A priest!" said the man. "Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are notgoing to demand any money of me? You are the cure, are you not? the cureof this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived yourskull-cap."As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. MademoiselleBaptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:"You are humane, Monsieur le Cure; you have not scorned me. A goodpriest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?""No," said the Bishop; "keep your money. How much have you? Did you nottell me one hundred and nine francs?""And fifteen sous," added the man."One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take youto earn that?""Nineteen years.""Nineteen years!"The Bishop sighed deeply.The man continued: "I have still the whole of my money. In four days Ihave spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload somewagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbe, I will tell you that we had achaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneuris what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He isthe cure who rules over the other cures, you understand. Pardon me,I say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! Youunderstand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on analtar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glitteredin the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the threesides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could not seevery well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not hear. Thatis what a bishop is like."While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which hadremained wide open.Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which sheplaced on the table."Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "place those things as near the fireas possible." And turning to his guest: "The night wind is harsh on theAlps. You must be cold, sir."Each time that he uttered the word sir, in his voice which was so gentlygrave and polished, the man's face lighted up. Monsieur to a convict islike a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa. Ignominythirsts for consideration."This lamp gives a very bad light," said the Bishop.Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silvercandlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur's bed-chamber, andplaced them, lighted, on the table."Monsieur le Cure," said the man, "you are good; you do not despise me.You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet Ihave not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunateman."The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. "Youcould not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it isthe house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enterswhether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you arehungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not saythat I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the manwho needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are muchmore at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What needhave I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one whichI knew."The man opened his eyes in astonishment."Really? You knew what I was called?""Yes," replied the Bishop, "you are called my brother.""Stop, Monsieur le Cure," exclaimed the man. "I was very hungry whenI entered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what hashappened to me."The Bishop looked at him, and said,--"You have suffered much?""Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogsare happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellowpassport. That is what it is like.""Yes," resumed the Bishop, "you have come from a very sad place.Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of arepentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If youemerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath againstmankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts ofgood-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us."In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made withwater, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, afresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord,added to the Bishop's ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.The Bishop's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which ispeculiar to hospitable natures. "To table!" he cried vivaciously. As washis custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on hisright. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, tookher seat at his left.The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according tohis custom. The man began to eat with avidity.All at once the Bishop said: "It strikes me there is something missingon this table."Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks andspoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of thehouse, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the wholesix sets of silver on the table-cloth--an innocent ostentation. Thisgraceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play, which was fullof charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty intodignity.Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word,and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded bythe Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged beforethe three persons seated at the table.CHAPTER IV--DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannotdo better than to transcribe here a passage from one of MademoiselleBaptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversationbetween the convict and the Bishop is described with ingeniousminuteness.". . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracityof a starving man. However, after supper he said:"'Monsieur le Cure of the good God, all this is far too good for me; butI must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keepa better table than you do.'"Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:--"'They are more fatigued than I.'"'No,' returned the man, 'they have more money. You are poor; I see thatplainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a cure? Ah, if thegood God were but just, you certainly ought to be a cure!'"'The good God is more than just,' said my brother."A moment later he added:--"'Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?'"'With my road marked out for me.'"I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:--"'I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If thenights are cold, the days are hot.'"'You are going to a good country,' said my brother. 'During theRevolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comte atfirst, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My willwas good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There arepaper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factorieson a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries atleast, four of which, situated at Lods, at Chatillon, at Audincourt, andat Beure, are tolerably large.'"I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which mybrother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:--"'Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?'"I replied,--"'We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of thegates at Pontarlier under the old regime.'"'Yes,' resumed my brother; 'but in '93, one had no longer anyrelatives, one had only one's arms. I worked. They have, in thecountry of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, atruly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is theircheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.'"Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, withgreat minuteness, what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were; that theywere divided into two classes: the big barns which belong to the rich,and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven toeight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres, whichbelong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who holdtheir cows in common, and share the proceeds. 'They engage the servicesof a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin receives themilk of the associates three times a day, and marks the quantity ona double tally. It is towards the end of April that the work of thecheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that thecheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.'"The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drinkthat good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he saysthat wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with thateasy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing hiswords with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to thatcomfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand,without advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford hima refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well,neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brotherutter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus whenhe entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what mybrother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching hima little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that amark of the passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to anyone else who had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chanceto nourish his soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon himsome reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or a littlecommiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in thefuture. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came,nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and mybrother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To sucha point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speakingof the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor nearheaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, hestopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped himsomething which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I thinkI have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart. He wasthinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had hismisfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thingwas to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily,that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in hisordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is therenot, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy whichabstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not thetruest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It hasseemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. Inany case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, hegave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the sameas he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with thesame air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M.Gedeon le Provost, or with the curate of the parish."Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock atthe door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. Mybrother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which Ihad about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying muchheed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very muchfatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brothersaid grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, 'You must bein great need of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared the table verypromptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow thistraveller to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs. Nevertheless, Isent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man's bed agoat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights arefrigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; allthe hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany,at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the littleivory-handled knife which I use at table."Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in thedrawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired toour own chambers, without saying a word to each other."CHAPTER V--TRANQUILLITYAfter bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one ofthe two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to hisguest, and said to him,--"Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room."The man followed him.As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house wasso arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove wassituated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop'sbedroom.At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire wasputting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed.This was her last care every evening before she went to bed.The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had beenprepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table."Well," said the Bishop, "may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning,before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.""Thanks, Monsieur l'Abbe," said the man.Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of asudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which wouldhave frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it.Even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him atthat moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace?Was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscureeven to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, andbending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:--"Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?"He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked somethingmonstrous:--"Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been anassassin?"The Bishop replied:--"That is the concern of the good God."Then gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talkingto himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed hisbenediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head orlooking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall towall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as hepassed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden,walking, meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbedin those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to theeyes which remain open.As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profitby the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrilsafter the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, uponthe bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.CHAPTER VI--JEAN VALJEANTowards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learnedto read in his childhood. When he reached man's estate, he became atree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; hisfather was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and acontraction of viola Jean, "here's Jean."Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition whichconstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant aboutJean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and motherat a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had notbeen properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, hadbeen killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjeanwas a sister older than himself,--a widow with seven children, boys andgirls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had ahusband she lodged and fed her young brother.The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.The youngest, one.Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took thefather's place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had broughthim up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishlyon the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude andill-paid toil. He had never known a "kind woman friend" in his nativeparts. He had not had the time to fall in love.He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word.His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast fromhis bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, theheart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. As he went oneating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, hislong hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the airof perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, notfar from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane,a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habituallyfamished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, intheir mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alleycorner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the littlegirls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their motherhad known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquentsseverely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude forthe pint of milk behind their mother's back, and the children were notpunished.In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out asa hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He didwhatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do withseven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which wasbeing gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no work.The family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square atFaverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow onthe grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passedthrough a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and theglass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ranout in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ranafter him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but hisarm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunalsof the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house atnight. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world,he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists alegitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler,smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remarkcursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and thehideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, thesmuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferociousmen because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest,make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often withoutdestroying the humane side.Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit.There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments whenthe penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that inwhich society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonmentof a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in thegalleys.On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by thegeneral-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directoryto the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaveswas put in chains at Bicetre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang.An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, stillrecalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end ofthe fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated onthe ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position,except that it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, wasdisentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant ofeverything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar wasbeing riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept,his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed tosay from time to time, "I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles." Then stillsobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times,as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights,and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done,whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishingseven little children.He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-sevendays, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed inthe red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name,was effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601.What became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Whotroubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves fromthe young tree which is sawed off at the root?It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creaturesof God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge,wandered away at random,--who even knows?--each in his own directionperhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist whichengulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear insuccession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race.They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their villageforgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them;after a few years' residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgotthem. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar.That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon,did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towardsthe end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through whatchannels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in theirown country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poorstreet Rear Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her onlyone child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhapsshe did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office,No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obligedto be there at six o'clock in the morning--long before daylight inwinter. In the same building with the printing office there was aschool, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven yearsold. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school onlyopened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the schoolto open, for an hour--one hour of a winter night in the open air! Theywould not allow the child to come into the printing office, because hewas in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, theybeheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome withdrowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down anddoubled up over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress,took pity on him; she took him into her den, where there was a pallet, aspinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in acorner, pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less fromcold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he entered. That is whatwas told to Jean Valjean.They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash,as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of thosethings whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing moreforever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheldthem; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournfulhistory they will not be met with any more.Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean's turn to escapearrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place.He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if beingat liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake atthe slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a smoking roof,of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a strikingclock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannotsee, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the eveningof the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept forthirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime,to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years.In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himselfof it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing atroll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found himhidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; heresisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. Thiscase, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition offive years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In thetenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; hesucceeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years.Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a lastattempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of fourhours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. InOctober, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for havingbroken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.Room for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during hisstudies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author ofthis book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point ofdeparture for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gueux had stolen a loaf;Jean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact thatfour thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate cause.Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emergedimpassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.What had taken place in that soul?CHAPTER VII--THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIRLet us try to say it.It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it isitself which creates them.He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. Thelight of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses aclearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylightwhich existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, inthe cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon theplank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness andmeditated.He constituted himself the tribunal.He began by putting himself on trial.He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustlypunished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthyact; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused tohim had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better towait until he could get it through compassion or through work; thatit is not an unanswerable argument to say, "Can one wait when one ishungry?" That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die ofhunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, manis so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally andphysically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to havepatience; that that would even have been better for those poor littlechildren; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable,unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that thatis in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery throughwhich infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.Then he asked himself--Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whetherit was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, anindustrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault oncecommitted and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious anddisproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part ofthe law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the partof the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been anexcess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which containsexpiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalentto the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing thesituation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of therepression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtorinto the creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of theman who had violated it.Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations forattempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrageperpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society againstthe individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every day, acrime which had lasted nineteen years.He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force itsmembers to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lackof foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and toseize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default ofwork and an excess of punishment.Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely thoseof its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goodsmade by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.He condemned it to his hatred.He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he saidto himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to callit to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibriumbetween the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being doneto him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment wasnot, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully;one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's sideat bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had neverseen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, andwhich it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him tobruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, sincehis infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he everencountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering tosuffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is awar; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weaponthan his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it awaywith him when he departed.There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantinfriars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of theunfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who hada mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read,to write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was tofortify his hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment canserve to eke out evil.This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which hadcaused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society,and he condemned it also.Thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted andat the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on theother.Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still goodwhen he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and feltthat he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and wasconscious that he was becoming impious.It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can theman created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul becompletely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Canthe heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities andinfirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness,as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in everyhuman soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, afirst spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal inthe other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow withsplendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish?Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologistwould probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, hadhe beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for JeanValjean hours of revery, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with foldedarms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust intohis pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, and thoughtful,a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, condemned bycivilization, and regarding heaven with severity.Certainly,--and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,--theobserving physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; hewould, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law's making; buthe would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned asidehis gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse withinthis soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effacedfrom this existence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless,inscribed upon the brow of every man,--hope.Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, asperfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it forthose who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after theirformation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of theirformation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Hadthis rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception ofthe succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted anddescended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formedthe inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passedwithin him, and of all that was working there? That is somethingwhich we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not evenbelieve. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after hismisfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. Attimes he did not rightly know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was inthe shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; onemight have said that he hated in advance of himself. He dwelt habituallyin this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer. Only, atintervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, anaccess of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash whichilluminated his whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all aroundhim, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideousprecipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny.The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He nolonger knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in whichthat which is pitiless--that is to say, that which isbrutalizing--predominates, is to transform a man, little by little, bya sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into aferocious beast.Jean Valjean's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alonesuffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul.Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless andfoolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself,without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experienceswhich he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolfwho finds his cage open. Instinct said to him, "Flee!" Reason would havesaid, "Remain!" But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reasonvanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. Whenhe was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served torender him still more wild.One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physicalstrength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of thegalleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, JeanValjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormousweights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced thatimplement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil[pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of theRue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades hadnicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing thebalcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids ofPuget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the pointof falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid withhis shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who wereforever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of forceand skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system ofmysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are foreverenvious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to findpoints of support where hardly a projection was visible, was play toJean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of hisback and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevennessof the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. Hesometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison.He spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion wasrequired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laughof the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To allappearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation ofsomething terrible.He was absorbed, in fact.Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushedintelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing wasresting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled,each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance,he perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightfulaccumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond therange of his vision,--laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,--whose outlinesescaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else thanthat prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished,here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, nowafar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail,vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there thegendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top,like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to himthat these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, renderedit more funereal and more black. All this--laws, prejudices, deeds, men,things--went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with thecomplicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization,walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulnessin its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which havefallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in thelowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved ofthe law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable forhim who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upontheir heads.In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the natureof his meditation?If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full ofrealities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state whichis almost indescribable.At times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. Hisreason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,rose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to himabsurd; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He saidto himself, "It is a dream." He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing afew paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All ofa sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.Visible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to saythat there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days,nor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-holedaylight habitually illumined his soul.To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translatedinto positive results in all that we have just pointed out, we willconfine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteenyears, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, theformidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the mannerin which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action:firstly, of evil action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing,entirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil whichhe had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave,consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas whichsuch a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed throughthree successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alonetraverse,--reasoning, will, perseverance. He had for moving causes hishabitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignitiessuffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and thejust, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the pointof arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatredwhich, if it be not arrested in its development by some providentialincident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, thenthe hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and whichmanifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm tosome living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it wasnot without reason that Jean Valjean's passport described him as a verydangerous man.From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatalsureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure fromthe galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.CHAPTER VIII--BILLOWS AND SHADOWSA man overboard!What matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombreship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on.The man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to thesurface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is not heard. Thevessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its ownworkings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man;his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. Hegives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre isthat retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It retreats,it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he wasone of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the rest, he hadhis part of breath and of sunlight, he was a living man. Now, what hastaken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all is at an end.He is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what fleesand crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass himhideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues ofwater dash over his head; a populace of waves spits upon him; confusedopenings half devour him; every time that he sinks, he catches glimpsesof precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations seizehim, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he isbecoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss himfrom one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly oceanattacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony.It seems as though all that water were hate.Nevertheless, he struggles.He tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makesan effort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly,combats the inexhaustible.Where, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows ofthe horizon.The wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his eyesand beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid hisdeath-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by thismadness; he hears noises strange to man, which seem to come from beyondthe limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful regionbeyond.There are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above humandistresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float,and he, he rattles in the death agony.He feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky,at one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.Night descends; he has been swimming for hours; his strength isexhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, hasvanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, hestiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrousbillows of the invisible; he shouts.There are no more men. Where is God?He shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on.Nothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.He implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they aredeaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only theinfinite.Around him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult,the undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue.Beneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomyadventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless coldparalyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and graspnothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, useless stars! What isto be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses thealternative of death; he resists not; he lets himself go; he abandonshis grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depthsof engulfment.Oh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men and ofsouls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip!Disastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death!The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws flingtheir condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.The soul, going down stream in this gulf, may become a corpse. Who shallresuscitate it?CHAPTER IX--NEW TROUBLESWhen the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, whenJean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! themoment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a rayof the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But itwas not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled bythe idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedilyperceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport isprovided.And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated thathis earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount toa hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he hadforgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundaysand festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminutionof about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced byvarious local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteensous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He hadunderstood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us saythe word--robbed.On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front ofan orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. Heoffered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He setto work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the masterseemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observedhim, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellowpassport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little whilebefore he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which theyearned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty sous. Whenevening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day,he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to bepaid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. Heobjected. He was told, "That is enough for thee." He persisted. Themaster looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him "Beware ofthe prison."There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale.Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.Liberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but notfrom the sentence.That is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner hewas received at D----CHAPTER X--THE MAN AROUSEDAs the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty yearssince he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, thesensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He wasaccustomed not to devote many hours to repose.He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; thenhe closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matterspreoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time.Sleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to JeanValjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one'smind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. Hismemories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated therepell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becomingdisproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy andperturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one whichkept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away allothers. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the sixsets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire hadplaced on the table.Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few pacesdistant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach theone in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the actof placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.--He hadtaken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you entered fromthe dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.--From the ladle onecould get at least two hundred francs.--Double what he had earned innineteen years.--It is true that he would have earned more if "theadministration had not robbed him."His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there wascertainly mingled some struggle. Three o'clock struck. He opened hiseyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretchedout his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on acorner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost withoutknowing it, seated on his bed.He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would havebeen suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen himthus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all weresleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placedthem softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtfulattitude, and became motionless once more.Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have aboveindicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of revery, ofa convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whosetrousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. Thecheckered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the half or quarterhour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, "Come on!"He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; allwas quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps,to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not verydark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven bythe wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light,eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort oftwilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way,intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid lightwhich falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersbycome and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It hadno grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to thefashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as arush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closedit again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gazewhich studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerablylow white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceivedtops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that thewall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man whohas made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, openedit, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on thebed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing upagain, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew thevisor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in theangle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized theobject which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar ofiron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been difficult todistinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron couldhave been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothingmore than a miner's candlestick. Convicts were, at that period,sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environToulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners' tools at theircommand. These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated atthe lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck intothe rock.He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and tryingto deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door ofthe adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closedit.CHAPTER XI--WHAT HE DOESJean Valjean listened. Not a sound.He gave the door a push.He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with thefurtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silentmovement, which enlarged the opening a little.He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough toallow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, whichformed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost,to enlarge the aperture still further.He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, moreenergetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenlyemitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears withsomething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Dayof Judgment.In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imaginedthat that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed aterrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one,and warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering,bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. Heheard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, andit seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roarof the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that thehorrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed theentire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed byhim, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise atonce; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to theirassistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in anuproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himselflost.He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daringto make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wideopen. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there.He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by therusty hinge had not awakened any one.This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumultwithin him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thoughthimself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finishas soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague andconfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papersscattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, anarm-chair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hourwere only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced withprecaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He couldhear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing ofthe sleeping Bishop.He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived theresooner than he had thought for.Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actionswith sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired tomake us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered theheavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed,this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversingthe long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face. He wassleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, onaccount of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool,which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on thepillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with thepastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so manyholy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole facewas illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and offelicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a radiance. He bore uponhis brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible.The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven waswithin him. That heaven was his conscience.[Illustration: The Fall  1b2-10-the-fall]At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. Itremained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. Thatmoon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, addedsome solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man,and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that whitehair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all wasconfidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,without being himself aware of it.Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his ironcandlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never hadhe beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. Themoral world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled anduneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,contemplating the slumber of the just.That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, hadabout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiouslyconscious.No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. Inorder to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of themost violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even onhis visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything withcertainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, andthat was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible todivine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded. Butwhat was the nature of this emotion?His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearlyto be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strangeindecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the twoabysses,--the one in which one loses one's self and that in which onesaves one's self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss thathand.At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towardshis brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the samedeliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap inhis left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all overhis savage head.The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifyinggaze.The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over thechimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them,with a benediction for one and pardon for the other.Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidlypast the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard,which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though toforce the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing whichpresented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it,traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautionsand without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door,re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrodethe window-sill of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack,threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like atiger, and fled.CHAPTER XII--THE BISHOP WORKSThe next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in hisgarden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation."Monseigneur, Monseigneur!" she exclaimed, "does your Grace know wherethe basket of silver is?""Yes," replied the Bishop."Jesus the Lord be blessed!" she resumed; "I did not know what hadbecome of it."The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presentedit to Madame Magloire."Here it is.""Well!" said she. "Nothing in it! And the silver?""Ah," returned the Bishop, "so it is the silver which troubles you? Idon't know where it is.""Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night hasstolen it."In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, MadameMagloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returnedto the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as heexamined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had brokenas it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire's cry."Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!"As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of thegarden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. Thecoping of the wall had been torn away."Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!"The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,and said gently to Madame Magloire:--"And, in the first place, was that silver ours?"Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishopwent on:--"Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silverwrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man,evidently.""Alas! Jesus!" returned Madame Magloire. "It is not for my sake, nor forMademoiselle's. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake ofMonseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?"The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement."Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?"Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders."Pewter has an odor.""Iron forks and spoons, then."Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace."Iron has a taste.""Very well," said the Bishop; "wooden ones then."A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at whichJean Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, andto Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one reallydoes not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bitof bread in a cup of milk."A pretty idea, truly," said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went andcame, "to take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one's self!And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it makesone shudder to think of it!"As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there camea knock at the door."Come in," said the Bishop.The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on thethreshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The threemen were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, wasstanding near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making amilitary salute."Monseigneur--" said he.At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,raised his head with an air of stupefaction."Monseigneur!" he murmured. "So he is not the cure?""Silence!" said the gendarme. "He is Monseigneur the Bishop."In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as hisgreat age permitted."Ah! here you are!" he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. "I am glad tosee you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, whichare of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get twohundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks andspoons?"Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishopwith an expression which no human tongue can render any account of."Monseigneur," said the brigadier of gendarmes, "so what this man saidis true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who isrunning away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had thissilver--""And he told you," interposed the Bishop with a smile, "that it had beengiven to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passedthe night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him backhere? It is a mistake.""In that case," replied the brigadier, "we can let him go?""Certainly," replied the Bishop.The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled."Is it true that I am to be released?" he said, in an almostinarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep."Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?" said one of thegendarmes."My friend," resumed the Bishop, "before you go, here are yourcandlesticks. Take them."He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, andbrought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without utteringa word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert theBishop.Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticksmechanically, and with a bewildered air."Now," said the Bishop, "go in peace. By the way, when you return, myfriend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can alwaysenter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened withanything but a latch, either by day or by night."Then, turning to the gendarmes:--"You may retire, gentlemen."The gendarmes retired.Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:--"Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this moneyin becoming an honest man."Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he utteredthem. He resumed with solemnity:--"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. Itis your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts andthe spirit of perdition, and I give it to God."CHAPTER XIII--LITTLE GERVAISJean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set outat a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and pathspresented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantlyretracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without havingeaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throngof novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did notknow against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he wastouched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotionwhich he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired duringthe last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him.He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which theinjustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way withinhim. He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would haveactually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that thingsshould not have happened in this way; it would have agitated him less.Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a fewlate flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passedthrough them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood.These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since theyhad recurred to him.Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart thesoil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a largeruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on thehorizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. JeanValjean might have been three leagues distant from D---- A path whichintersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed nota little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might haveencountered him, a joyous sound became audible.He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and hismarmot-box on his back.One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affordinga view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time totime, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in hishand--his whole fortune, probably.Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, andtossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caughtwith a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards thebrushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caughtsight of him.He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there wasnot a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing theheavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back tothe sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with itsblood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean."Sir," said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which iscomposed of ignorance and innocence, "my money.""What is your name?" said Jean Valjean."Little Gervais, sir.""Go away," said Jean Valjean."Sir," resumed the child, "give me back my money."Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.The child began again, "My money, sir."Jean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth."My piece of money!" cried the child, "my white piece! my silver!"It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped himby the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made aneffort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure."I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!"The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated.His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in aterrible voice, "Who's there?""I, sir," replied the child. "Little Gervais! I! Give me back my fortysous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!"Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:--"Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we'llsee!""Ah! It's still you!" said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to hisfeet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:--"Will you take yourself off!"The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head tofoot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the topof his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certaindistance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his ownrevery.At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.The sun had set.The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothingall day; it is probable that he was feverish.He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after thechild's flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregularintervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemedto be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancientfragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at oncehe shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically tocross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up hiscudgel.At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foothad half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles.It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. "What is this?"he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted,without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot hadtrodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay glitteringthere in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards thesilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began togaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towardsall points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like aterrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, greatbanks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.He said, "Ah!" and set out rapidly in the direction in which the childhad disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about himand saw nothing.Then he shouted with all his might:--"Little Gervais! Little Gervais!"He paused and waited.There was no reply.The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space.There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze waslost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him asort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms withincredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening andpursuing some one.He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time totime he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which wasthe most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible tohear, "Little Gervais! Little Gervais!"Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed andwould have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was nodoubt already far away.He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:--"Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?""No," said the priest."One named Little Gervais?""I have seen no one."He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to thepriest."Monsieur le Cure, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Cure, hewas a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and ahurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?""I have not seen him.""Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?""If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Suchpersons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them."Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence,and gave them to the priest."For your poor," he said.Then he added, wildly:--"Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested. I am a thief."The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had firsttaken.In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plaintowards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human beingreclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwoodor rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot wherethree paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. Hesent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, "LittleGervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" His shout died away in themist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, "LittleGervais!" but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was his lasteffort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisiblepower had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evilconscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched inhis hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, "I am a wretch!"Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that hehad wept in nineteen years.When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen,quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. Hecould not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. Hehardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of theold man. "You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul.I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the goodGod."This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindnesshe opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He wasindistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatestassault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that hisobduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if heyielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which theactions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, andwhich pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to beconquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had beenbegun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who isintoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinctperception of what might result to him from his adventure at D----? Didhe understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune thespirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear thathe had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longerremained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth thebest of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so tospeak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict;that if he wished to become good be must become an angel; that if hewished to remain evil, he must become a monster?Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already putto ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in histhought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, doesform the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtfulwhether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we havehere indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpsesof, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him intoan unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging fromthat black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishophad hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes onemerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offereditself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremorsand anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, whoshould suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled andblinded, as it were, by virtue.That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was nolonger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it wasno longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken tohim and had not touched him.In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbedhim of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it;was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of theevil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,--a remnant ofimpulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired force? Itwas that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say itsimply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hithertounheard-of thoughts besetting it.When intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the brute, JeanValjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.[Illustration: Awakened  1b2-11-awakened]It was because,--strange phenomenon, and one which was possible onlyin the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money fromthat child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect onhim; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, anddispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the otherthe light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, ascertain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitatingone element and clarifying the other.First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, allbewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find thechild in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized thefact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment whenhe exclaimed "I am a wretch!" he had just perceived what he was, and hewas already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed tohimself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had,there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, JeanValjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filledwith stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage,with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sorta visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually sawthat Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reachedthe point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified byhim.His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calmmoments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality. One nolonger beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, asthough apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's ownmind.Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the sametime, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth asort of light which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizingthis light which appeared to his conscience with more attention, herecognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torchwas the Bishop.His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,--theBishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required tosoften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiarto this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as theBishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean growless and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything morethan a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; hefilled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed withmore weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; anextraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His pastlife, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, hisinternal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plansof vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thingthat he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all themore cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after theBishop's pardon,--all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearlyto him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed.He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and itseemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over thislife and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the lightof Paradise.How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept?Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to beauthenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble atthat epoch, and who arrived at D---- about three o'clock in the morning,saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop's residence wassituated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement inthe shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.BOOK THIRD.--IN THE YEAR 1817CHAPTER I--THE YEAR 18171817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurancewhich was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign.It is the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. All thehairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird,were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was thecandid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden inthe church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in his costume of apeer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majestyof profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action.The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor ofBordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city alittle too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angouleme. Hence his peerage. In1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years ofage in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimauxmitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of theAustrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers theybore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and sinceEngland refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned.In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned;Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. Therewere still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacyhad just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, ofPleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand,grand chamberlain, and the Abbe Louis, appointed minister of finance,laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs;both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass offederation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louishad served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleysof this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might havebeen seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, withtraces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. Thesewere the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor'splatform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there withthe scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Twoor three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, andhad warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May hadthis remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and inthe Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular:the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box a la Charter. The most recentParisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother'shead into the fountain of the Flower-Market.They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account ofthe lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destinedto cover Chaumareix with infamy and Gericault with glory. Colonel Selveswas going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, inthe Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform ofthe octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards,which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomerunder Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read tothree or four friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnishedby X. in sky-blue satin. The N's were scratched off the Louvre. Thebridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of theKing's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised thebridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. LouisXVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of hisfinger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoeswho have become dauphins, had two anxieties,--Napoleon and MathurinBruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, TheHappiness procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent.In his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general ofBroe, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a falseChateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be afalse Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel weremasterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of theepoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, strickenfrom its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angouleme into anaval school; for the Duc d'Angouleme, being lord high admiral, it wasevident that the city of Angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport;otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. Inthe Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettesrepresenting slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi'sadvertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins,should be tolerated. M. Paer, the author of Agnese, a good sort offellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the littleprivate concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque.All the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with wordsby Edmond Geraud. The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The CafeLemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Cafe Valois, which upheldthe Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow byLouvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Staelhad died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars.The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted,but their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional.La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That made the goodmiddle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer.In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted theexiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longerany wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it istrue that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant of thefact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, asthe police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is nonew fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, ina Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letterswhich had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals asamusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. Whatseparated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, orto say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to sayNapoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that theera of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed"The Immortal Author of the Charter." On the platform of the Pont-Neuf,the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue ofHenry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the rough draftof his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of theRight said at grave conjunctures, "We must write to Bacot." MM. Canuel,O'Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to someextent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to become later on "TheConspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau"--of the waterside. L'Epingle Noire wasalready plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring withTrogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriandstood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad infooted trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over hisgray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist'sinstruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which werecharming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter toM. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone,preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmannsigned himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. Divorce wasabolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decoratedon the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos ofthe King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to herRoyal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. theDuc d'Orleans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of acolonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform ofcolonel-general of dragoons--a serious inconvenience. The city ofParis was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense.Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such orsuch an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers pointsfrom M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. Thecomedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Molierehad not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odeon,upon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OFTHE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnetde Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. TheLiberal, Pelicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the followingtitle: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. "That will attractpurchasers," said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M.Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning tognaw at him--a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:--     "Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws."As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappeswas begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain,afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting hissublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science,whom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier,whom the future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark;a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms:a certain Lord Baron. David d'Angers was trying to work in marble. TheAbbe Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering ofseminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest,named Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thingwhich smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dogwent and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royalto the Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was notgood for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-riddeninventor; an utopia--a steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently atthis useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute bya coup d'etat, the distinguished author of numerous academicians,ordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, couldnot succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and thepavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, onaccount of his piety. Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel inthe amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each otherwith their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier,with one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigotedreaction by reconciling fossils with texts and by making mastodonsflatter Moses.M. Francois de Neufchateau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memoryof Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme de terre [potato]pronounced parmentiere, and succeeded therein not at all. The AbbeGregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in theroyalist polemics, to the state of "Infamous Gregoire." The locution ofwhich we have made use--passed to the state of--has been condemned as aneologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont de Jena,the new stone with which, the two years previously, the mining aperturemade by Blucher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was stillrecognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice summoned to its bar aman who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had said aloud:"Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter theBel Sauvage, arm in arm." A seditious utterance. Six months in prison.Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to theenemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, andstrutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches anddignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness oftheir well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy inthe most barefaced manner.This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and isnow forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannotdo otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, thesedetails, which are wrongly called trivial,--there are no trivial factsin humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,--are useful. It is ofthe physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries iscomposed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged "a finefarce."CHAPTER II--A DOUBLE QUARTETTEThese Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the thirdfrom Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; andwhen one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to beborn in Paris.These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; fourspecimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neitherwise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with thatcharming April which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars; for,at that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. Burn for him the perfumes ofAraby! exclaimed romance. Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him!People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian andCaledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, andthe first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle ofWaterloo.These Oscars bore the names, one of Felix Tholomyes, of Toulouse; thesecond, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last,Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England;Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of aflower; Fameuil idolized Zephine, an abridgment of Josephine; Tholomyeshad Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.Favourite, Dahlia, Zephine, and Fantine were four ravishing young women,perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not yetentirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues,but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil,and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fallin woman. One of the four was called the young, because she wasthe youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one wastwenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were moreexperienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of lifethan Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.Dahlia, Zephine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much.There had already been more than one episode in their romance, thoughhardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in thefirst chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustavein the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scoldsand the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people haveboth of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badlyguarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and thestones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor ofall that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau werehungry?Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zephine. Shehad had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father wasan old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart,who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This professor, whenhe was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid's gown catch ona fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident. Theresult had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and hebowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee,had entered her apartments, and had said to her, "You do not know me,Mamemoiselle?" "No." "I am your mother." Then the old woman opened thesideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned brought in,and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke toFavourite, remained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined,and supped for four, and went down to the porter's quarters for company,where she spoke ill of her daughter.It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia toListolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nailswork? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands.As for Zephine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and caressinglittle way of saying "Yes, sir."The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such lovesare always accompanied by such friendships.Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of thisis that, after making all due allowances for these little irregularhouseholds, Favourite, Zephine, and Dahlia were philosophical youngwomen, while Fantine was a good girl.Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyes? Solomon would reply thatlove forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying thatthe love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.She alone, of all the four, was not called "thou" by a single one ofthem.Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregsof the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depthsof social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and theunknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She hadnever known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? Shehad never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directorystill existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismalname; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleasedthe first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very smallchild, running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as shereceived the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She wascalled little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creaturehad entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quittedthe town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. Atfifteen she came to Paris "to seek her fortune." Fantine was beautiful,and remained pure as long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, withfine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was onher head, and her pearls were in her mouth.She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,--forthe heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved.She loved Tholomyes.An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning oftheir dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes of the hillof the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but insuch a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way ofavoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of whichTholomyes was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.Tholomyes was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income offour thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal onMount Sainte-Genevieve. Tholomyes was a fast man of thirty, and badlypreserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of abald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull at thirty,the knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attackedby a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared,gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hairwith mirth, his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly.He was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth, which was packingup for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good order,bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had apiece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. Inaddition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is avast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, hewas the leader. Iron is an English word. Is it possible that irony isderived from it?One day Tholomyes took the three others aside, with the gesture of anoracle, and said to them:--"Fantine, Dahlia, Zephine, and Favourite have been teasing us for nearlya year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that wewould. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular,just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, 'Facciagialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,' so ourbeauties say to me incessantly, 'Tholomyes, when will you bring forthyour surprise?' At the same time our parents keep writing to us.Pressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let usdiscuss the question."Thereupon, Tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something somirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the fourmouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, "That is an idea."A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder oftheir confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which tookplace on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the fouryoung girls.CHAPTER III--FOUR AND FOURIt is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what a pleasure-trip ofstudents and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago.The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of whatmay be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the lasthalf-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car;where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speakof Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Parisof 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.The four couples conscientiously went through with all the countryfollies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was awarm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only onewho knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyes in thename of the four: "It is a good hour to emerge from happiness." Thatis why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. Then they went toSaint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, "Thismust be very beautiful when there is water!" They breakfasted at theTete-Noir, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves to agame of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain;they ascended Diogenes' lantern, they gambled for macaroons at theroulette establishment of the Pont de Sevres, picked bouquets atPateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, andwere perfectly happy.The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from theircage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed littletaps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years!the wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you notremember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside thebranches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you?Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a belovedwoman holding your hand, and crying, "Ah, my new boots! what a statethey are in!"Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking inthe case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as theyset out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, "The slugs are crawlingin the paths,--a sign of rain, children."All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a goodfellow who had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolledthat day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass aboutten o'clock in the morning, and exclaimed, "There is one too many ofthem," as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, theone aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the greatgreen boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, andpresided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun.Zephine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way thatthey set each off when they were together, and completed each other,never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than fromfriendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; thefirst keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawningfor women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of thetender sex began to droop dolefully. Zephine and Dahlia had their hairdressed in rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, who were engaged in discussingtheir professors, explained to Fantine the difference that existedbetween M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite'ssingle-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux's manufacture, on hisarm on Sundays.Tholomyes followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one feltthe force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality;his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern ofnankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattanworth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself toeverything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing wassacred to him; he smoked."That Tholomyes is astounding!" said the others, with veneration. "Whattrousers! What energy!"As for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth hadevidently received an office from God,--laughter. She preferred to carryher little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her handrather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined towave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fastenup incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under thewillows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouthvoluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had anair of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes droopeddiscreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though tocall a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and strikingabout her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddishbrown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-workedstockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention,whose name, canezou, a corruption of the words quinze aout, pronouncedafter the fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather, heat, andmidday. The three others, less timid, as we have already said,wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneathflower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the sideof these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou, with itstransparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing anddisplaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend ofdecency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtessede Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded theprize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the prize ofmodesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavylids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a whiteskin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins tobe seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of theJuno of AEgina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelledas though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visiblethrough the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural andexquisite--such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments andthese ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those raredreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confronteverything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this littleworking-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of theancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred.She was beautiful in the two ways--style and rhythm. Style is the formof the ideal; rhythm is its movement.We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed fromher athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and herlove affair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. Sheremained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shadeof difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long,white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of thesacred fire with a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothingto Tholomyes, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, herface in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almostaustere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and therewas nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become sosuddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness withoutany transition state. This sudden and sometimes severely accentuatedgravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, herchin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinctfrom equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenanceresults; in the very characteristic interval which separates the baseof the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charmingfold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall inlove with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.Love is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high overfault.CHAPTER IV--THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTYThat day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All natureseemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds ofSaint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled theleaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged thejasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow,the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King ofFrance there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers,the trees, were resplendent.And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing,chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-workstockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received,to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine,who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed ofdreaminess and wildness, and who was in love. "You always have a queerlook about you," said Favourite to her.Such things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profoundappeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth fromeverything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forestsexpressly for those in love,--in that eternal hedge-school of lovers,which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as thereare hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers.The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limbof the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in oldentimes, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and thereis in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis--what a transfigurationeffected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries,the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, thosejargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in themanner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn from one mouth byanother,--all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestialglories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They think that thiswill never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe theseecstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzledby it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painterof plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into theazure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, andd'Urfe mingles druids with them.After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King'sSquare to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes ourmemory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting allParis to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem,whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads,were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub theair of a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiringcrowd about it.After viewing the shrub, Tholomyes exclaimed, "I offer you asses!" andhaving agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returnedby way of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The trulynational park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happenedto be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite inhis grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinetof mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or ofTurcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swingattached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbe de Bernis.As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds in thefluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid pealsof laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyes, who was somewhat of a Spaniard,Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, theold ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing infull flight upon a rope between two trees:--      "Soy de Badajoz,        "Badajoz is my home,       Amor me llama,          And Love is my name;       Toda mi alma,           To my eyes in flame,       Es en mi ojos,          All my soul doth come;       Porque ensenas,         For instruction meet       A tuas piernas.         I receive at thy feet"Fantine alone refused to swing."I don't like to have people put on airs like that," muttered Favourite,with a good deal of acrimony.After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed theSeine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached thebarrier of l'Etoile. They had been up since five o'clock that morning,as the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such thing as fatigueon Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does not work.About three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness,were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which thenoccupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visibleabove the trees of the Champs Elysees.From time to time Favourite exclaimed:--"And the surprise? I claim the surprise.""Patience," replied Tholomyes.CHAPTER V--AT BOMBARDA'SThe Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think aboutdinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, becamestranded in Bombarda's public house, a branch establishment which hadbeen set up in the Champs-Elysees by that famous restaurant-keeper,Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, nearDelorme Alley.A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they hadbeen obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sundaycrowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quayand the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes;two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingledwith the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seatedround a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugsof beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table,some disorder beneath it;               "They made beneath the table     A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,"says Moliere.This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock inthe morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun wassetting; their appetites were satisfied.The Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothingbut light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. Thehorses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloudof gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificentbody-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending theAvenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the settingsun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde,which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happypromenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from thewhite-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared frombutton-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girlsthrew to the winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles andapplauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strikethe Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:--               "Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand,                    Rendez-nous notre pere."               "Give us back our father from Ghent,                    Give us back our father."Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes evendecorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over thelarge square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolvingon the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeymanprinters had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Every thingwas radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalistsecurity; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chiefof Police Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris,terminated with these lines:--"Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to befeared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These arevery pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make oneof your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of thepopulace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature ofthis population should have diminished in the last fifty years; andthe populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of theRevolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble."Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transformitself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies themiracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despisedby Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In theireyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant tothe Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square inCorinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of theRestoration beheld the populace of Paris in too "rose-colored" a light;it is not so much of "an amiable rabble" as it is thought. The Parisianis to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleepsmore soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy thanhe, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not betrusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but whenthere is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in everysort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; givehim a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon's stay and Danton'sresource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question ofliberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath,is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Takecare! he will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand CaudineForks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow instature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, andhis breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from thatslender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is,thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed witharms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his songto his nature, and you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothingbut la Carmagnole, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing theMarseillaise, and he will free the world.This note jotted down on the margin of Angles' report, we will return toour four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close.CHAPTER VI--A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHERChat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one asthe other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.Fameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomyes was drinking. Zephine waslaughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which hehad purchased at Saint-Cloud.Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:--"Blachevelle, I adore you."This called forth a question from Blachevelle:--"What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?""I!" cried Favourite. "Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you wereto cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you,I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have youarrested."Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who istickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:--"Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself,not at all! Rabble!"Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closedboth eyes proudly.Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:--"So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?""I? I detest him," replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her forkagain. "He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in myhouse. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can seethat he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comesin, his mother says to him: 'Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone.There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting myhead!' So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high ashe can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I knowwhat? so that he can be heard down stairs! He earns twenty sous a day atan attorney's by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentorof Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so,that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said tome: 'Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.' Itis only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice.I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. Nevermind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him--how I lie! Hey! How I dolie!"Favourite paused, and then went on:--"I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; thewind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy;there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what toeat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and thenyou see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it,and that disgusts me with life."CHAPTER VII--THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYESIn the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuouslyall at once; it was no longer anything but noise. Tholomyes intervened."Let us not talk at random nor too fast," he exclaimed. "Let us reflect,if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the mind ina stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let usmingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us makehaste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the springtime; if it makeshaste, it is done for; that is to say, it gets frozen. Excess of zealruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace andthe mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reyniereagrees with Talleyrand."A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group."Leave us in peace, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle."Down with the tyrant!" said Fameuil."Bombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!" cried Listolier."Sunday exists," resumed Fameuil."We are sober," added Listolier."Tholomyes," remarked Blachevelle, "contemplate my calmness [moncalme].""You are the Marquis of that," retorted Tholomyes.This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool.The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All thefrogs held their peace."Friends," cried Tholomyes, with the accent of a man who had recoveredhis empire, "Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from theskies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which fallsin that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The punis the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where;and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azuredepths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent thecondor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honorit in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, themost sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside ofhumanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses onIsaac, AEschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe thatCleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not beenfor it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek namewhich signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation.I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even inwitticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I havethe prudence of Amphiaraus and the baldness of Caesar. There must be alimit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus."There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of appleturnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matterof turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises theglutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good God withpreaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of ourpassions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. Inall things the word finis must be written in good season; self-controlmust be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawnon appetite; one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carryone's self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a givenmoment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for Ihave succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according tothe verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between thequestion put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis inLatin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome at theepoch when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide; because Iam going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it isabsolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you tomoderation in your desires. It is true that my name is Felix Tholomyes;I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroicresolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes."Favourite listened with profound attention."Felix," said she, "what a pretty word! I love that name. It is Latin;it means prosper."Tholomyes went on:--"Quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to feelthe prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothingmore simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hardlabor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil,gorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymphaeas; drinkemulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet,starve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, theapplication of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate oflead, and fomentations of oxycrat.""I prefer a woman," said Listolier."Woman," resumed Tholomyes; "distrust her. Woe to him who yields himselfto the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and disingenuous.She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The serpent is theshop over the way.""Tholomyes!" cried Blachevelle, "you are drunk!""Pardieu," said Tholomyes."Then be gay," resumed Blachevelle."I agree to that," responded Tholomyes.And, refilling his glass, he rose."Glory to wine! Nunc te, Bacche, canam! Pardon me ladies; that isSpanish. And the proof of it, senoras, is this: like people, like cask.The arrobe of Castile contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante,twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin of theBalearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Longlive that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was stillgreater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in yourneighbor if you see fit. The property of love is to err. A loveaffair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an Englishserving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is notmade for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, erroris human; I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zephine, OJosephine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you notall askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one hassat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymphs and muses! one daywhen Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guerin-Boisseau,he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, whichdisplayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fellin love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionianlips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed thepainter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paintthy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of thename. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it likeEve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thouwho hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautifulwoman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as 'thou,' because I passfrom poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little while ago.That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They maydelude us. I am called Felix, and I am not happy. Words are liars. Letus not blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would bea mistake to write to Liege [2] for corks, and to Pau for gloves. MissDahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A flower shouldsmell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of Fantine; sheis a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is a phantompossessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who hasstrayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions,and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very wellknowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her eyes fixedon heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are inexistence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyes, I am all illusion; butshe does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest,everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light.O Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are awoman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: donot marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill; avoid that risk.But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurableon the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will notprevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreamingof husbands studded with diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties,remember this, you eat too much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman,and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little whiteteeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts arewithering. Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks theliquids of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, and thenthe solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hencedeath. That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do not crunchsugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest,rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across.In love there are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty womanhostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is acasus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasionsof history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man's right.Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women;Caesar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars likea vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to allthose unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamationof Bonaparte to the army of Italy: "Soldiers, you are in need ofeverything; the enemy has it."Tholomyes paused."Take breath, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle.At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed ofthe first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, asdestitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind,which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated andtake their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the groupreplied to Tholomyes' harangue:--           "The father turkey-cocks so grave            Some money to an agent gave,            That master good Clermont-Tonnerre            Might be made pope on Saint Johns' day fair.            But this good Clermont could not be            Made pope, because no priest was he;            And then their agent, whose wrath burned,            With all their money back returned."This was not calculated to calm Tholomyes' improvisation; he emptied hisglass, filled, refilled it, and began again:--"Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither prudesnor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be merry.Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating! Indigestion andthe digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting, the female! Joy inthe depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great diamond. I am happy.The birds are astonishing. What a festival everywhere! The nightingaleis a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! OGeorgics of the Rue Madame, and of the Allee de l'Observatoire! Opensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming nurses who, while theyguard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas of America would pleaseme if I had not the arcades of the Odeon. My soul flits away into thevirgin forests and to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz inthe sun. The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!"He made a mistake and embraced Favourite.CHAPTER VIII--THE DEATH OF A HORSE"The dinners are better at Edon's than at Bombarda's," exclaimedZephine."I prefer Bombarda to Edon," declared Blachevelle. "There is moreluxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there aremirrors [glaces] on the walls.""I prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate," said Favourite.Blachevelle persisted:--"Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda's and of boneat Edon's. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.""Except for those who have a silver chin," observed Tholomyes.He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible fromBombarda's windows.A pause ensued."Tholomyes," exclaimed Fameuil, "Listolier and I were having adiscussion just now.""A discussion is a good thing," replied Tholomyes; "a quarrel isbetter.""We were disputing about philosophy.""Well?""Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?""Desaugiers," said Tholomyes.This decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:--"I consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can stilltalk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie.One lies, but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpectedbursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. There are still humanbeings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of theparadox merrily. This, ladies, which you are drinking with so tranquilan air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural dasFreiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level ofthe sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms!and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives youthose three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fiftycentimes."Again Fameuil interrupted him:--"Tholomyes, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?""Ber--""Quin?""No; Choux."And Tholomyes continued:--"Honor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could butget me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chaeronea if he couldbring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas inGreece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same,and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation!Nil sub sole novum, says Solomon; amor omnibus idem, says Virgil; andCarabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasiaembarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word. Do youknow what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch when womenhad, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purplehue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia wasa creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddessprostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case amistress should be needed for Prometheus."Tholomyes, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping,had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. Theshock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was aBeauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which wasdragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda's, theworn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. Thisincident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carterhad time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, Matin (thejade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell,never to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passersby,Tholomyes' merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyes tookadvantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close withthis melancholy strophe:--      "Elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses [3]          Ont le meme destin;      Et, rosse, elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses,          L'espace d'un matin!""Poor horse!" sighed Fantine.And Dahlia exclaimed:--"There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one besuch a pitiful fool as that!"At that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back,looked resolutely at Tholomyes and said:--"Come, now! the surprise?""Exactly. The moment has arrived," replied Tholomyes. "Gentlemen,the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us amoment, ladies.""It begins with a kiss," said Blachevelle."On the brow," added Tholomyes.Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow; then all four filedout through the door, with their fingers on their lips.Favourite clapped her hands on their departure."It is beginning to be amusing already," said she."Don't be too long," murmured Fantine; "we are waiting for you."CHAPTER IX--A MERRY END TO MIRTHWhen the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on thewindow-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from onewindow to the other.They saw the young men emerge from the Cafe Bombarda arm in arm. Thelatter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared inthat dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into theChamps-Elysees."Don't be long!" cried Fantine."What are they going to bring us?" said Zephine."It will certainly be something pretty," said Dahlia."For my part," said Favourite, "I want it to be of gold."Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of thelake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, andwhich diverted them greatly.It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through theChamps-Elysees. The majority followed the quay and went through thePassy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellowand black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapelessby trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediatelydisappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge,with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements,changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted theyoung girls. Favourite exclaimed:--"What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away."It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see withdifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set outagain at a gallop. This surprised Fantine."That's odd!" said she. "I thought the diligence never stopped."Favourite shrugged her shoulders."This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out ofcuriosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I ama traveller; I say to the diligence, 'I will go on in advance; you shallpick me up on the quay as you pass.' The diligence passes, sees me,halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, mydear."In this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made amovement, like a person who is just waking up."Well," said she, "and the surprise?""Yes, by the way," joined in Dahlia, "the famous surprise?""They are a very long time about it!" said Fantine.As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinnerentered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter."What is that?" demanded Favourite.The waiter replied:--"It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.""Why did you not bring it at once?""Because," said the waiter, "the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver itto the ladies for an hour."Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand. It was, in fact, aletter."Stop!" said she; "there is no address; but this is what is written onit--"                 "THIS IS THE SURPRISE."She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how toread]:--"OUR BELOVED:--"You must know that we have parents. Parents--you do not know much aboutsuch things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code,which is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folksimplore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons;they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous,we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses willbe bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up our stakes, asBossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Lafitteand on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us fromthe abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return tosociety, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of threeleagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that weshould be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families,rural police, and councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificingourselves. Mourn for us in haste, and replace us with speed. If thisletter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu."For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear youno grudge for that.                                 "Signed:                                            BLACHEVELLE.                                            FAMUEIL.                                            LISTOLIER.                                            FELIX THOLOMYES."Postscriptum. The dinner is paid for."The four young women looked at each other.Favourite was the first to break the silence."Well!" she exclaimed, "it's a very pretty farce, all the same.""It is very droll," said Zephine."That must have been Blachevelle's idea," resumed Favourite. "It makesme in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is anadventure, indeed.""No," said Dahlia; "it was one of Tholomyes' ideas. That is evident."In that case," retorted Favourite, "death to Blachevelle, and long liveTholomyes!""Long live Tholomyes!" exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine.And they burst out laughing.Fantine laughed with the rest.An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It washer first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to thisTholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.BOOK FOURTH.--TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON'S POWERCHAPTER I--ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHERThere was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of thiscentury, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop waskept by some people named Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situatedin Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat againstthe wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled aman carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big giltepaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots representedblood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probablyrepresented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OFSERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de Waterloo).Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry.Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment ofa vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of theSergeant of Waterloo, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainlyhave attracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who had passedthat way.It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in woodedtracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and thetrunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive ironaxle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, andwhich was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact,overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of anenormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, thefellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideousyellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fondof ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and theiron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain,worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not thebeams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons andmammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of thegalleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to havebeen detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus withit, and Shakespeare, Caliban.Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? Inthe first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it mightfinish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in theold social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walksabout outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than theabove.The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and inthe loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, onthat particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls;one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; theyounger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted aboutthem, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of thatfrightful chain, and had said, "Come! there's a plaything for mychildren."The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, wereradiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amidold iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full oflaughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faceswere two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near waftedto the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the childof eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with thechaste indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicateheads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the giganticfore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curvesand wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A fewpaces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, themother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touchingat that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord,watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with that animal andcelestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every backwardand forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, whichresembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the settingsun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be more charming than thiscaprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing ofcherubim.As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice aromance then celebrated:--                 "It must be, said a warrior."Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearingand seeing what was going on in the street.In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning thefirst couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying verynear her ear:--"You have two beautiful children there, Madame."                 "To the fair and tender Imogene--"replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had achild, which she carried in her arms.She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed veryheavy.This woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it ispossible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She couldhave entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far asthe coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds ofher skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, anddimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beautyinspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of hereyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, andthat they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to herage. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleepprofoundly.As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. Shewas dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasantagain. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire itwas not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemedvery thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close,nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth whenone has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have beendry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rathersickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms withthe air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large bluehandkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, andconcealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dottedwith freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with theneedle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown,and coarse shoes. It was Fantine.It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, onscrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retainedher beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,wrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette ofmuslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music,full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautifuland dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight;it melts and leaves the branch quite black.Ten months had elapsed since the "pretty farce."What had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediatelylost sight of Favourite, Zephine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on theside of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have beengreatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that theyhad been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing.Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,--alas! suchruptures are irrevocable,--she found herself absolutely isolated, minusthe habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by herliaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, shehad neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. She hadno resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how towrite; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name;she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, then asecond, then a third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. Fantine heardthe gossips say, as they looked at her child: "Who takes those childrenseriously! One only shrugs one's shoulders over such children!" Then shethought of Tholomyes, who had shrugged his shoulders over his child,and who did not take that innocent being seriously; and her heart grewgloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? She no longer knew towhom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of hernature, as will be remembered, was modesty and virtue. She was vaguelyconscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and ofgliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed it, andheld herself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. surM. occurred to her. There, some one might possibly know her and give herwork; yes, but it would be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confusedway she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be morepainful than the first one. Her heart contracted, but she took herresolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce bravery of life.She had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself inlinen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons,and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left toher, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which producedfor her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only abouteighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful springmorning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one whohad seen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had,in all the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all theworld, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this hadtired her chest, and she coughed a little.We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes. Let usconfine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King LouisPhilippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and influential, awise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a man of pleasure.Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for thesake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, inwhat was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris, the"little suburban coach service," Fantine found herself at Montfermeil,in the alley Boulanger.As she passed the Thenardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissfulin the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted infront of that vision of joy.Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is anannouncement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheldthe mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures wereevidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotionthat at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath betweentwo couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to herthe remark which we have just read:--"You have two pretty children, Madame."The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on theiryoung.The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarersit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on thethreshold. The two women began to chat."My name is Madame Thenardier," said the mother of the two little girls."We keep this inn."Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming betweenher teeth:--                 "It must be so; I am a knight,                  And I am off to Palestine."This Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin andangular--the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness; andwhat was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusalof romances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romancesproduce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shopwoman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouchingwoman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of aperambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened thetraveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed whatcaused what we have to relate to vanish. A person who is seated insteadof standing erect--destinies hang upon such a thing as that.The traveller told her story, with slight modifications.That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that herwork in Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek itelsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris that morningon foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she hadgot into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemombleshe had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked alittle, but not much, because she was so young, and that she had beenobliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which wokeher. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother's, andlooked at--what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air oflittle children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence inthe presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feelthemselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the childbegan to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped tothe ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wishedto run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing,stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.Mother Thenardier released her daughters, made them descend from theswing, and said:--"Now amuse yourselves, all three of you."Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expirationof a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer atmaking holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.The new-comer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in thegayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served herfor a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. Thegrave-digger's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed bya child.The two women pursued their chat."What is your little one's name?""Cosette."For Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child's name was Euphrasie. But outof Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and gracefulinstinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha intoPepita, and Francoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative whichdisarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We haveknown a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon."How old is she?""She is going on three.""That is the age of my eldest."In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude ofprofound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big wormhad emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were inecstasies over it.Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that therewere three heads in one aureole."How easily children get acquainted at once!" exclaimed MotherThenardier; "one would swear that they were three sisters!"This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had beenwaiting for. She seized the Thenardier's hand, looked at her fixedly,and said:--"Will you keep my child for me?"The Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signifyneither assent nor refusal.Cosette's mother continued:--"You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will notpermit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculousin the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. WhenI caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy,it overwhelmed me. I said: 'Here is a good mother. That is just thething; that will make three sisters.' And then, it will not be longbefore I return. Will you keep my child for me?""I must see about it," replied the Thenardier."I will give you six francs a month."Here a man's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:--"Not for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance.""Six times seven makes forty-two," said the Thenardier."I will give it," said the mother."And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses," added theman's voice."Total, fifty-seven francs," said Madame Thenardier. And she hummedvaguely, with these figures:--                 "It must be, said a warrior.""I will pay it," said the mother. "I have eighty francs. I shall haveenough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shallearn money there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for mydarling."The man's voice resumed:--"The little one has an outfit?""That is my husband," said the Thenardier."Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.--I understood perfectlythat it was your husband.--And a beautiful outfit, too! a senselessoutfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is here,in my carpet-bag.""You must hand it over," struck in the man's voice again."Of course I shall give it to you," said the mother. "It would be veryqueer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!"The master's face appeared."That's good," said he.The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gaveup her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, nowreduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforthand set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. Peoplearrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!A neighbor of the Thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out,and came back with the remark:--"I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough torend your heart."When Cosette's mother had taken her departure, the man said to thewoman:--"That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs whichfalls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I shouldhave had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trapnicely with your young ones.""Without suspecting it," said the woman.CHAPTER II--FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURESThe mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the catrejoices even over a lean mouse.Who were these Thenardiers?Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch lateron.These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse peoplewho have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descendedin the scale, which is between the class called "middle" and the classdenominated as "inferior," and which combines some of the defects of thesecond with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessingthe generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of thebourgeois.They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warmthem up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratumof the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both weresusceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progresswhich is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-likesouls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience toaugment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming moreand more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man andwoman possessed such souls.Thenardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One canonly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they aredark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threateningin front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no moreanswer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadowwhich they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing themutter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse ofsombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.This Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier--asergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. Weshall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of hishostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted ithimself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, afterhaving been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, still noble,but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle deScuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette toMadame Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portressesof Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. MadameThenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. Shelived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This hadgiven her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensiveattitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffianlettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and thesame time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to theperusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and "in what concerns the sex," as he saidin his jargon--a downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve orfifteen years younger than he was. Later on, when her hair, arranged ina romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magaerabegan to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothingbut a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances. Now,one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldestdaughter was named Eponine; as for the younger, the poor little thingcame near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effectedby a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely borethe name of Azelma.However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous andsuperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and whichmay be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side ofthis romantic element which we have just indicated there is the socialsymptom. It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the nameof Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there arestill any vicomtes--to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. Thisdisplacement, which places the "elegant" name on the plebeian and therustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality.The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there aseverywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and aprofound thing,--the French Revolution.CHAPTER III--THE LARKIt is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. Thecook-shop was in a bad way.Thanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been ableto avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following monththey were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's outfit toParis, and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs. As soonas that sum was spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on thelittle girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, theydressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardierbrats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the resthad left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat.Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar totheirs.The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M.sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter everymonth, that she might have news of her child. The Thenardiers repliedinvariably, "Cosette is doing wonderfully well."At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francsfor the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerableregularity from month to month. The year was not completed whenThenardier said: "A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does sheexpect us to do with her seven francs?" and he wrote to demand twelvefrancs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that herchild was happy, "and was coming on well," submitted, and forwarded thetwelve francs.Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other.Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused herto hate the stranger.It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainousaspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed toher as though it were taken from her own, and that that little childdiminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like manywomen of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows andinjuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certainthat her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the wholeof it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows toherself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could notmake a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower ofviolent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, whoshould not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantlypunished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two littlecreatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette. Eponine and Azelma werevicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The sizeis smaller; that is all.A year passed; then another.People in the village said:--"Those Thenardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they arebringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!"They thought that Cosette's mother had forgotten her.In the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible to say bywhat obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that themother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, sayingthat "the creature" was growing and "eating," and threatening to sendher away. "Let her not bother me," he exclaimed, "or I'll fire her bratright into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase." Themother paid the fifteen francs.From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two otherchildren; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say,before she was even five years old, she became the servant of thehousehold.Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it istrue. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen thetrial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from theage of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world,"worked for his living and stole"?Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard,the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thenardiersconsidered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner,since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular inher payments. Some months she was in arrears.If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these threeyears, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty androsy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had anindescribably uneasy look. "The sly creature," said the Thenardiers.Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothingremained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because,large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a stilllarger amount of sadness.It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six yearsold, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes,sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tinyred hands, and a tear in her great eyes.[Illustration: Cossette Sweeping  1b4-1-cossette-sweeping]She was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are fondof these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name onthis trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no biggerthan a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in thehouse or the village, and was always in the street or the fields beforedaybreak.Only the little lark never sang.BOOK FIFTH.--THE DESCENT.CHAPTER I--THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETSAnd in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according tothe people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where wasshe? What was she doing?After leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers, she had continuedher journey, and had reached M. sur M.This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had changedits aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchednessto wretchedness, her native town had prospered.About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are thegrand events of small districts had taken place.This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it atlength; we should almost say, to underline it.From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry theimitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. Thisindustry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the rawmaterial, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantinereturned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken placein the production of "black goods." Towards the close of 1815 a man,a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspiredwith the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laidtogether, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.This very small change had effected a revolution.This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost ofthe raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, toraise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the secondplace, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in thethird place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, whichwas a benefit to the manufacturer.Thus three results ensued from one idea.In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better.He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known;of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he hadcome to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of aningenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn hisown fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,and the language of a workingman.It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry intothe little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken outin the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at therisk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of thegendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport.Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.CHAPTER II--MADELEINEHe was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, andwho was good. That was all that could be said about him.Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirablyre-constructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchasesthere each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in thisbranch of commerce. Father Madeleine's profits were such, that at theend of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in whichthere were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women.Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure offinding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men goodwill, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separatedthe work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women andgirls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was theonly thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the morefirmly set on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town,opportunities for corruption abounded. However, his coming had been aboon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine's arrival,everything had languished in the country; now everything lived witha healthy life of toil. A strong circulation warmed everything andpenetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown.There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; nodwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing:Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the causeand the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thingin a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were hischief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little ofhimself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirtythousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before reservingthese six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than amillion for the town and its poor.The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. isdivided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which helived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin:he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted asalary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice aslarge as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some onewho expressed surprise, "The two prime functionaries of the state arethe nurse and the schoolmaster." He created at his own expense an infantschool, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding oldand infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in whichthere were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; heestablished there a free dispensary.At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, "He'sa jolly fellow who means to get rich." When they saw him enrichingthe country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, "He isan ambitious man." This seemed all the more probable since the man wasreligious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thingwhich was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly tolow mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalryeverywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputyhad been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared thereligious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the nameof Fouche, Duc d'Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. Heindulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheldthe wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock,he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; hetook a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to vespers. Ambitionwas at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to thesteeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, forthe honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which madetwelve.Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the townto the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and inconsideration of the services rendered by him to the country, FatherMadeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those whohad pronounced this new-comer to be "an ambitious fellow," seized withdelight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, "There!what did we say!" All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was wellfounded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the Moniteur. Onthe following day Father Madeleine refused.In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented byMadeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made theirreport, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion ofHonor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the crossthat he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of theirpredicament by saying, "After all, he is some sort of an adventurer."We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed himeverything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had beenobliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adoredhim, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity.When he was known to be rich, "people in society" bowed to him, andhe received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, MonsieurMadeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him FatherMadeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. Inproportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him."Society" claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms onM. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They madea thousand advances to him. He refused.This time the good gossips had no trouble. "He is an ignorant man, ofno education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how tobehave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows howto read."When they saw him making money, they said, "He is a man of business."When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, "He is anambitious man." When he was seen to decline honors, they said, "He isan adventurer." When they saw him repulse society, they said, "He is abrute."In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services whichhe had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion ofthe whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King againappointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefectresisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implorehim, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorousthat he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemedchiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostropheaddressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him fromher threshold, in an angry way: "A good mayor is a useful thing. Is hedrawing back before the good which he can do?"This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had becomeMonsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.CHAPTER III--SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTEOn the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He hadgray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, thethoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with awide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. Hefulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived insolitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions;he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity oftalking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling, Thewomen said of him, "What a good-natured bear!" His pleasure consisted instrolling in the fields.He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which heread. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; booksare cold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him withfortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It hadbeen observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M.. his languagehad grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with every passingyear. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls, but he rarelymade use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting was somethingso infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensiveanimal. He never shot at a little bird.Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was stillprodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was inneed of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, orstopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets fullof money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When hepassed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, andsurrounded him like a swarm of gnats.It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to thepeasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling itand the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solutionof common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot inbloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and inthe houses.He had "recipes" for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail,and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbitwarren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placedin it.One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles;he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said:"They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how tomake use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellentvegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres like hemp andflax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up, nettles aregood for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed ofthe nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; theroot, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter.Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what isrequired for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only theseed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to collect it. Thatis all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be madeuseful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is exterminated. Howmany men resemble the nettle!" He added, after a pause: "Remember this,my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There areonly bad cultivators."The children loved him because he knew how to make charming littletrifles of straw and cocoanuts.When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he soughtout funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief ofothers attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled withthe friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, withthe priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to histhoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision ofthe other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with asort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sadvoices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in themas a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated housesprivately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretchon returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened,sometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamorover it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the firstthing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece offurniture. The "malefactor" who had been there was Father Madeleine.He was affable and sad. The people said: "There is a rich man who hasnot a haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air."Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that noone ever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite's cell,furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones andskulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegantand malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked:"Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be agrotto." He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this "grotto."They were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simplyfurnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture ofthat sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous. They could see nothingremarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique pattern whichstood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, "for they werehall-marked," an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns.Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into theroom, and that it was a hermit's cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, atomb.It was also whispered about that he had "immense" sums deposited withLaffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at hisimmediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make hisappearance at Laffitte's any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off histwo or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, "these two or threemillions" were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty orforty thousand francs.CHAPTER IV--M. MADELEINE IN MOURNINGAt the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M.Myriel, Bishop of D----, surnamed "Monseigneur Bienvenu," who had diedin the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.The Bishop of D---- to supply here a detail which the papersomitted--had been blind for many years before his death, and content tobe blind, as his sister was beside him.Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact,one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth,where nothing is complete. To have continually at one's side a woman, adaughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need herand because she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensableto a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measureone's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us,and to say to ourselves, "Since she consecrates the whole of her timeto me, it is because I possess the whole of her heart"; to behold herthought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of onebeing amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gownas the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return,sing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of thisspeech; to manifest at each instant one's personal attraction; to feelone's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; to becomein one's obscurity, and through one's obscurity, the star around whichthis angel gravitates,--few felicities equal this. The supreme happinessof life consists in the conviction that one is loved; loved forone's own sake--let us say rather, loved in spite of one's self; thisconviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is to becaressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight whenone has love. And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue! Thereis no blindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly,and finds it. And this soul, found and tested, is a woman. A handsustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is hermouth: you hear a breath very near you; it is hers. To have everythingof her, from her worship to her pity, never to be left, to have thatsweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable reed, totouch Providence with one's hands, and to be able to take it inone's arms,--God made tangible,--what bliss! The heart, that obscure,celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would notexchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there,uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; shevanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. One feels warmthapproaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity, withgayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there area thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void. Themost ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, andsupplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul.One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a paradise ofshadows.It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to theother.The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M.sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black,and with crape on his hat.This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemedto throw a light on M. Madeleine's origin. It was concluded that somerelationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. "He has goneinto mourning for the Bishop of D----" said the drawing-rooms; thisraised M. Madeleine's credit greatly, and procured for him, instantlyand at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. surM. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raisingthe quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop.M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, by themore numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smilesof the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, whowas curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, "M. le Maire isdoubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D----?"He said, "No, Madame.""But," resumed the dowager, "you are wearing mourning for him."He replied, "It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth."Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that heencountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about thecountry and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned,inquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told eachother about it: a great many of them passed that way.CHAPTER V--VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZONLittle by little, and in the course of time, all this oppositionsubsided. There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine,in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to,blackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more thanill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirelydisappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and towards1821 the moment arrived when the word "Monsieur le Maire" was pronouncedat M. sur M. with almost the same accent as "Monseigneur the Bishop"had been pronounced in D---- in 1815. People came from a distance of tenleagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He put an end to differences,he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Every one took him for thejudge, and with good reason. It seemed as though he had for a soul thebook of the natural law. It was like an epidemic of veneration, which inthe course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the wholedistrict.One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escapedthis contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained hisopponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinctkept him on the alert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though thereexisted in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, though pure andupright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies,which fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does nothesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace,and which never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, infallible,imperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligenceand to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever mannerdestinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence ofthe man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along astreet, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man oflofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavycane, and wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, andfollowed him with his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms anda slow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company withhis lower to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might betranslated by: "What is that man, after all? I certainly have seen himsomewhere. In any case, I am not his dupe."This person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was oneof those men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest thespectator's attention.His name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of aninspector. He had not seen Madeleine's beginnings. Javert owed the postwhich he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary ofthe Minister of State, Comte Angeles, then prefect of police at Paris.When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturerwas already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which iscomplicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority.Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we shouldbe able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individualof the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animalcreation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceivedby the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to thetiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man.Sometimes even several of them at a time.Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God showsthem to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mereshadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full senseof the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realitiesand having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed onthem intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of education. Socialeducation, when well done, can always draw from a soul, of whatever sortit may be, the utility which it contains.This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of theterrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profoundquestion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which arenot man. The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny thelatent _I_. Having made this reservation, let us pass on.Now, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every manthere is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for usto say what there was in Police Officer Javert.The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolvesthere is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, ashe grew up, he would devour the other little ones.Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will beJavert.Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband wasin the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the paleof society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed thatsociety unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,--those who attackit and those who guard it; he had no choice except between thesetwo classes; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribablefoundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with aninexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. Heentered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was aninspector.During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments ofthe South.Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to thewords, "human face," which we have just applied to Javert.The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deepnostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. Onefelt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two cavernsfor the first time. When Javert laughed,--and his laugh was rare andterrible,--his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth,but his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savagefold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a watchdog;when he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very littleskull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his forehead andfell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent, centralfrown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his mouth pursedup and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggeratingthem,--respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He envelopedin a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state,from the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with scorn,aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal thresholdof evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the one hand,he said, "The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate is neverthe wrong." On the other hand, he said, "These men are irremediablylost. Nothing good can come from them." He fully shared the opinion ofthose extreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what powerof making, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons,and who place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious,austere; a melancholy dreamer, humble and haughty, like fanatics. Hisglance was like a gimlet, cold and piercing. His whole life hung onthese two words: watchfulness and supervision. He had introduced astraight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world;he possessed the conscience of his usefulness, the religion of hisfunctions, and he was a spy as other men are priests. Woe to the manwho fell into his hands! He would have arrested his own father, ifthe latter had escaped from the galleys, and would have denounced hismother, if she had broken her ban. And he would have done it with thatsort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue. And, withal,a life of privation, isolation, abnegation, chastity, with nevera diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, as theSpartans understood Sparta, a pitiless lying in wait, a ferocioushonesty, a marble informer, Brutus in Vidocq.Javert's whole person was expressive of the man who spies and whowithdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph deMaistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those thingswhich were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to declarethat Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it disappearedbeneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were lost underhis eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged in hiscravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves:and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat. But when theoccasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from allthis shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular forehead, abaleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a monstrouscudgel.In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, althoughhe hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This couldbe recognized by some emphasis in his speech.As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself,he permitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection withhumanity.The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was theterror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministryof Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javertrouted them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them atsight.Such was this formidable man.Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full ofsuspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;but it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put aquestion to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore thatembarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it.He treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of theworld.It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he hadsecretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,and into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anteriortraces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed toknow, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleanedcertain information in a certain district about a family which haddisappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, "Ithink I have him!" Then he remained pensive for three days, and utterednot a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held hadbroken.Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the tooabsolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothingreally infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinctis that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.Otherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would befound to be provided with a better light than man.Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalnessand tranquillity of M. Madeleine.One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce animpression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.CHAPTER VI--FATHER FAUCHELEVENTOne morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. surM.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached.An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart,his horse having tumbled down.This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had atthat time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, anex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business whichwas beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simpleworkman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had filledhim with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion,to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man hadnothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, hehad turned carter.The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caughtin the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of thevehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. FatherFauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner.They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort,aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible todisengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him.Javert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for ajack-screw.M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully."Help!" cried old Fauchelevent. "Who will be good and save the old man?"M. Madeleine turned towards those present:--"Is there a jack-screw to be had?""One has been sent for," answered the peasant."How long will it take to get it?""They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot's place, where there is afarrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of anhour.""A quarter of an hour!" exclaimed Madeleine.It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushingthe old carter's breast more and more. It was evident that his ribswould be broken in five minutes more."It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour," said Madeleine tothe peasants, who were staring at him."We must!""But it will be too late then! Don't you see that the cart is sinking?""Well!""Listen," resumed Madeleine; "there is still room enough under the cartto allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only halfa minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here whohas stout loins and heart? There are five louis d'or to be earned!"Not a man in the group stirred."Ten louis," said Madeleine.The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: "A manwould need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of gettingcrushed!""Come," began Madeleine again, "twenty louis."The same silence."It is not the will which is lacking," said a voice.M. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed himon his arrival.Javert went on:--"It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thingas lift a cart like that on his back."Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every wordthat he uttered:--"Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doingwhat you ask."Madeleine shuddered.Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyesfrom Madeleine:--"He was a convict.""Ah!" said Madeleine."In the galleys at Toulon."Madeleine turned pale.Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Faucheleventrattled in the throat, and shrieked:--"I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!"Madeleine glanced about him."Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save thelife of this poor old man?"No one stirred. Javert resumed:--"I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, andhe was that convict.""Ah! It is crushing me!" cried the old man.Madeleine raised his head, met Javert's falcon eye still fixed uponhim, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, withoutsaying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even hadtime to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terribleweight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbowstogether. They shouted to him, "Father Madeleine, come out!" OldFauchelevent himself said to him, "Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You seethat I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!"Madeleine made no reply.All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, andit had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from underthe vehicle.Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, thewheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying,"Make haste! Help!" It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort.They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force andcourage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent wassaved.Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. Hisclothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissedhis knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore uponhis countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestialsuffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was stillstaring at him.CHAPTER VII--FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARISFauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleinehad him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for hisworkmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by twosisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found athousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in FatherMadeleine's writing: "I purchase your horse and cart." The cart wasbroken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his kneeremained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters ofcharity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in afemale convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first timethat Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave himauthority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dogmight experience on smelling a wolf in his master's clothes. Fromthat time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When therequirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he couldnot do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profoundrespect.This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besidesthe visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which wasnone the less significant for not being visible. This never deceives.When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is nocommerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts andoversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money inthe charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, whenthe country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost thestate nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometerof the public misery and riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes.In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes haddiminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and thisled to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest byM. de Villele, then Minister of Finance.Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. Noone remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine's factory waslike the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admittedto the women's workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; shecould not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little byher day's work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she wasearning her living.CHAPTER VIII--MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITYWhen Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for amoment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! Thetaste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass,took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fineteeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of thepossible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room andfurnished on credit on the strength of her future work--a lingeringtrace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she wasmarried she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her littlegirl.At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thenardiers promptly. Asshe only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through apublic letter-writer.She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in anundertone, in the women's workroom, that Fantine "wrote letters" andthat "she had ways about her."There is no one for spying on people's actions like those who arenot concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except atnightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail onTuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madamealways descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Whydoes she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a"whole stationer's shop full of it?" etc. There exist beings who, forthe sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, ofno consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time,take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, andthat gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any otherpayment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such andsuch a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hoursat a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night,in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make thedrivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborna porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing,and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And oftenthese secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmasilluminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels,failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joyof those who have "found out everything," without any interest in thematter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking.Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of theanteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they needa great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished bytheir neighbors.So Fantine was watched.In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her whiteteeth.It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in themidst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when shewas thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that shepaid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:Monsieur, Monsieur Thenardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil. The publicwriter, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red winewithout emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in thewine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. "Shemust be a pretty sort of a woman." An old gossip was found, who made thetrip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thenardiers, and said on her return:"For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen thechild."The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, theguardian and door-keeper of every one's virtue. Madame Victurnien wasfifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age.A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once beenyoung--astonishing fact! In her youth, in '93, she had married amonk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed fromthe Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp,captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widowshe was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to hiswill. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible.At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energythat the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property,which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community.She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this MadameVicturnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, "I haveseen the child."All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than ayear, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed herfifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employedin the shop, and requested her, in the mayor's name, to leave theneighborhood.This was the very month when the Thenardiers, after having demandedtwelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead oftwelve.Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she wasin debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficientto cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. Thesuperintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides,Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, evenmore than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room.So her fault was now known to every one.She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised tosee the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francsbecause he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. Shebowed before the decision.CHAPTER IX--MADAME VICTURNIEN'S SUCCESSSo the monk's widow was good for something.But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of justsuch combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almostnever entering the women's workroom.At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whomthe priest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in thissuperintendent,--a truly respectable person, firm, equitable, upright,full of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the samedegree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving.M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are often obligedto delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and theconviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent hadinstituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M.Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for givingassistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood;she went from house to house. No one would have her. She could notleave town. The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for herfurniture--and what furniture!--said to her, "If you leave, I will haveyou arrested as a thief." The householder, whom she owed for her rent,said to her, "You are young and pretty; you can pay." She divided thefifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned tothe latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and foundherself without work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed, andstill about fifty francs in debt.She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earnedtwelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this point thatshe began to pay the Thenardiers irregularly.However, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returnedat night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living onlittle, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; thefirst is dark, the second is black.Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how togive up a bird which eats a half a farthing's worth of millet everytwo days; how to make a coverlet of one's petticoat, and a petticoat ofone's coverlet; how to save one's candle, by taking one's meals bythe light of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeblecreatures, who have grown old in privation and honesty, can get out ofa sou. It ends by being a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent,and regained a little courage.At this epoch she said to a neighbor, "Bah! I say to myself, by onlysleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing,I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one issad, one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little bread on onehand, trouble on the other,--all this will support me."It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her inthis distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make hershare her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the Thenardiers!How could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the lifeof indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was piouswith a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and eventowards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herselfMarguerite, and believing in God, which is science.There are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day theywill be in the world above. This life has a morrow.At first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behindher, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted her;the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very fleshand soul like a north wind.It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath thesarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, noone knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would haveliked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomedherself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At theexpiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began togo about as though there were nothing the matter. "It is all the same tome," she said.She went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, andwas conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticedthe distress of "that creature" who, "thanks to her," had been "put backin her proper place," and congratulated herself. The happiness of theevil-minded is black.Excess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubledher increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite, "Justfeel how hot my hands are!"Nevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning withan old broken comb, and it flowed about her like floss silk, sheexperienced a moment of happy coquetry.CHAPTER X--RESULT OF THE SUCCESSShe had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed,but winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth,no light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs,twilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. Thesky is but a vent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has the airof a beggar. A frightful season! Winter changes the water of heaven andthe heart of man into a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.Fantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thenardiers, whowere not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contentsdrove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wroteto her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather,that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at leastten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in herhands all day long. That evening she went into a barber's shop at thecorner of the street, and pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hairfell to her knees."What splendid hair!" exclaimed the barber."How much will you give me for it?" said she."Ten francs.""Cut it off."She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thenardiers. Thispetticoat made the Thenardiers furious. It was the money that theywanted. They gave the petticoat to Eponine. The poor Lark continued toshiver.Fantine thought: "My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with myhair." She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, andin which she was still pretty.Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine's heart.When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hateevery one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration forFather Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was hewho had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, shecame to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory inworking hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected tolaugh and sing.An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashionsaid, "There's a girl who will come to a bad end."She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love,out of bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp,a sort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and whoabandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust.She adored her child.The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the moreradiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said,"When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;" and she laughed. Hercough did not leave her, and she had sweats on her back.One day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in thefollowing terms: "Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the roundsof the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs arerequired. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If youdo not send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one willbe dead."She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: "Ah! they aregood! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do theythink I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly."Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read theletter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running andleaping and still laughing.Some one met her and said to her, "What makes you so gay?"She replied: "A fine piece of stupidity that some country people havewritten to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, youpeasants!"As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected arounda carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressedin red, who was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his rounds,who was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders andelixirs.Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest atthe harangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon forrespectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl,and suddenly exclaimed: "You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, whoare laughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, I will give you agold napoleon apiece for them.""What are my palettes?" asked Fantine."The palettes," replied the dental professor, "are the front teeth, thetwo upper ones.""How horrible!" exclaimed Fantine."Two napoleons!" grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. "Here'sa lucky girl!"Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarsevoice of the man shouting to her: "Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons;they may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening tothe inn of the Tillac d'Argent; you will find me there."Fantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence toher good neighbor Marguerite: "Can you understand such a thing? Is henot an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about thecountry! Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My hairwill grow again, but my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I shouldprefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story!He told me that he should be at the Tillac d'Argent this evening.""And what did he offer?" asked Marguerite."Two napoleons.""That makes forty francs.""Yes," said Fantine; "that makes forty francs."She remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of aquarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thenardiers'letter once more on the staircase.On her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:--"What is a miliary fever? Do you know?""Yes," answered the old spinster; "it is a disease.""Does it require many drugs?""Oh! terrible drugs.""How does one get it?""It is a malady that one gets without knowing how.""Then it attacks children?""Children in particular.""Do people die of it?""They may," said Marguerite.Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on thestaircase.That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in thedirection of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.The next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine's room beforedaylight,--for they always worked together, and in this manner used onlyone candle for the two,--she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale andfrozen. She had not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees.Her candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed.Marguerite halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendouswastefulness, and exclaimed:--"Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened."Then she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of itshair.Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night."Jesus!" said Marguerite, "what is the matter with you, Fantine?""Nothing," replied Fantine. "Quite the contrary. My child will not dieof that frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content."So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which wereglittering on the table."Ah! Jesus God!" cried Marguerite. "Why, it is a fortune! Where did youget those louis d'or?""I got them," replied Fantine.At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. Itwas a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, andshe had a black hole in her mouth.The two teeth had been extracted.She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.After all it was a ruse of the Thenardiers to obtain money. Cosette wasnot ill.Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quittedher cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fastenit, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an anglewith the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The pooroccupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of hisdestiny, only by bending over more and more.She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattresson the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebushwhich she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the othercorner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and inwhich the various levels of the water remained long marked by thesecircles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A finalsign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or fromindifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out,she dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from theperpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old and wornout, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement. Thepeople to whom she was indebted made "scenes" and gave her no peace.She found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. Shepassed many a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were very bright,and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of theleft shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated FatherMadeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours a day; buta contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at adiscount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earningsof working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and nine sous aday! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer,who had taken back nearly all his furniture, said to her incessantly,"When will you pay me, you hussy?" What did they want of her, good God!She felt that she was being hunted, and something of the wild beastdeveloped in her. About the same time, Thenardier wrote to her that hehad waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have ahundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out ofdoors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the cold andthe streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, and dieif she chose. "A hundred francs," thought Fantine. "But in what tradecan one earn a hundred sous a day?""Come!" said she, "let us sell what is left."The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.CHAPTER XI--CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVITWhat is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.From whom? From misery.From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soulfor a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it doesnot, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared fromEuropean civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighsonly upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty,maternity. This is not one of the least of man's disgraces.At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothingis left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.She has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold.She passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe anddishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last wordfor her. All has happened to her that will happen to her. She hasfelt everything, borne everything, experienced everything, sufferedeverything, lost everything, mourned everything. She is resigned, withthat resignation which resembles indifference, as death resembles sleep.She no longer avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her, and allthe ocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a sponge thatis soaked.At least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine thatfate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anythingwhatever.Alas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are theygoing? Why are they thus?He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow.He is alone. His name is God.CHAPTER XII--M. BAMATABOIS'S INACTIVITYThere is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular,a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundredfrancs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundredthousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuterspecies: impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, alittle folly, a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, andwho think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, "My fields,my peasants, my woods"; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove thatthey are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrisonto prove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell oftobacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from thediligence, live at the cafe, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats thebones under the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table;who stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despisewomen, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paristhrough the medium of Pont-A-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work,serve no use, and do no great harm.M. Felix Tholomyes, had he remained in his own province and never beheldParis, would have been one of these men.If they were richer, one would say, "They are dandies;" if they werepoorer, one would say, "They are idlers." They are simply men withoutemployment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers,and some knaves.At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, awatch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top ofthe other--the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat, witha codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to each otherand running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a lightershade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite, butalways uneven, number of lines, varying from one to eleven--a limitwhich was never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with little ironson the heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, anenormous cane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all,spurs and a mustache. At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois,and spurs the pedestrian.The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest ofmustaches.It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America withthe King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats wereroyalist, and were called morillos; liberals wore hats with wide brims,which were called bolivars.Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the precedingpages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one ofthese dandies, one of these unemployed, a "right thinker," for he worea morillo, and was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those largecloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, wasamusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in aball-dress, with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front ofthe officers' cafe. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedlyfashionable.Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her,together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he consideredwitty and mirthful, such as, "How ugly you are!--Will you get out of mysight?--You have no teeth!" etc., etc. This gentleman was known as M.Bamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre which went andcame through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance at him,and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and with a sombreregularity, which brought her every five minutes within reach of thissarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. Thesmall effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and takingadvantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind herwith the gait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up ahandful of snow from the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back,between her bare shoulders. The woman uttered a roar, whirled round,gave a leap like a panther, and hurled herself upon the man, burying hernails in his face, with the most frightful words which could fall fromthe guard-room into the gutter. These insults, poured forth in a voiceroughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in hideous wise from a mouthwhich lacked its two front teeth. It was Fantine.At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from thecafe, passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting andapplauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings,whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: theman struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feetand fists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, livid with wrath,horrible.Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd,seized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, andsaid to her, "Follow me!"The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Hereyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembledwith a quiver of terror. She had recognized Javert.The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.CHAPTER XIII--THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THEMUNICIPAL POLICEJavert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set outwith long strides towards the police station, which is situated at theextremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. Sheyielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud ofspectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme miseryan occasion for obscenity.On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by astove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guardedby a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shutthe door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, whoraised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of thethick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is asort of gluttony. To see is to devour.On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute,crouching down like a terrified dog.The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javertseated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and beganto write.This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretionof the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seemsgood to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things whichthey entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; hisgrave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriouslyand deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he wasexercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severeconscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he wasconscious that his police agent's stool was a tribunal. He was enteringjudgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which couldpossibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing.The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt.It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime.He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of afreeholder and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature who wasoutside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of acitizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to thesergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, "Take three men andconduct this creature to jail."Then, turning to Fantine, "You are to have six months of it." Theunhappy woman shuddered."Six months! six months of prison!" she exclaimed. "Six months in whichto earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter!my daughter! But I still owe the Thenardiers over a hundred francs; doyou know that, Monsieur Inspector?"She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of allthose men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strideson her knees."Monsieur Javert," said she, "I beseech your mercy. I assure you thatI was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would haveseen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! Thatgentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Hasany one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking alongpeaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see.And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time:'You are ugly! you have no teeth!' I know well that I have no longerthose teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, 'The gentleman is amusinghimself.' I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at thatmoment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good MonsieurInspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell youthat this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know thatone is not master of one's self at the first moment. One gives way tovivacity; and then, when some one puts something cold down yourback just when you are not expecting it! I did wrong to spoil thatgentleman's hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his pardon. Oh, my God!It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the favorto-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know that inprison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government'sfault, but seven sous is one's earnings; and just fancy, I must payone hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh, my God!I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, mylittle angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature?I will tell you: it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and suchpeople are unreasonable. They want money. Don't put me in prison! Yousee, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street toget along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you musthave pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If she were older,she might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I am not abad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have mademe what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do notlove it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was onlynecessary to glance into my closets, and it would have been evident thatI was not a coquettish and untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal oflinen. Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!"She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears,her neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short cough,stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a divine andterrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine hadbecome beautiful once more. From time to time she paused, and tenderlykissed the police agent's coat. She would have softened a heart ofgranite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened."Come!" said Javert, "I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished?You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person coulddo nothing more."At these solemn words, "the Eternal Father in person could do nothingmore," she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down,murmuring, "Mercy!"Javert turned his back.The soldiers seized her by the arms.A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heedto him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened toFantine's despairing supplications.At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunatewoman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:--"One moment, if you please."Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat,and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:--"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor--"The words "Mr. Mayor" produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She roseto her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth,thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M.Madeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him,with a bewildered air, she cried:--"Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!"Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:--"Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty."Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced atthat moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violentemotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman ofthe town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that, in hismost daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilegeto believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of histhought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and asto what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpseof I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. Butwhen he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face andsay, "Set this woman at liberty," he underwent a sort of intoxicationof amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total ofpossible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raisedher bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person whois reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in alow voice, as though talking to herself:--"At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for sixmonths! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have saidthat. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of amayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to beset free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let mego. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is thecause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! allbecause of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If thatis not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing herwork honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this miseryfollowed. In the first place, there is one improvement which thesegentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prisoncontractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, yousee: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls tonine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to becomewhatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actuallyforced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that thatblackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped onthat gentleman's hat in front of the officers' cafe; but he had spoiledmy whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress for eveningwear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately--truly, MonsieurJavert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I,and who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave ordersthat I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak to mylandlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I amperfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionallytouched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke."M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she wasspeaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and openedit. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, "Howmuch did you say that you owed?"Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:--"Was I speaking to you?"Then, addressing the soldiers:--"Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you oldwretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I'm not afraid ofyou. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good MonsieurJavert!"So saying, she turned to the inspector again:--"And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. Iunderstand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectlysimple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman's back, andthat makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way;and we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order,you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since youare a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is forthe sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent mysupporting my child. 'Only, don't do it again, you hussy!' Oh! I won'tdo it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to menow; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me.I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as Itold you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ballin my stomach, and the doctor tells me, 'Take care of yourself.' Here,feel, give me your hand; don't be afraid--it is here."She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert's coarsehand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped thefolds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herselfalong, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door,saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:--"Children, Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, andI am going."She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she wouldbe in the street.Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyesfixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue,which is waiting to be put away somewhere.The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expressionof sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming inproportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wildbeast, atrocious in the man of no estate."Sergeant!" he cried, "don't you see that that jade is walking off! Whobade you let her go?""I," said Madeleine.Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, and let go of the latchas a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the soundof Madeleine's voice she turned around, and from that moment forth sheuttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glancestrayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn,according to which was speaking.It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measurebefore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as hehad done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should be set atliberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any"authority" should have given such an order, and that the mayor mustcertainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intendingit? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for thepast two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur tosupreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small shouldbe made great, that the police spy should transform himself into amagistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, andthat, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government,society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as wehave just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward themayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole bodyagitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, andsay to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:--"Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.""Why not?" said M. Madeleine."This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.""Inspector Javert," replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,"listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explainingmatters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passingthrough the square just as you were leading this woman away; there werestill groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learnedeverything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should havebeen arrested by properly conducted police."Javert retorted:--"This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.""That concerns me," said M. Madeleine. "My own insult belongs to me, Ithink. I can do what I please about it.""I beg Monsieur le Maire's pardon. The insult is not to him but to thelaw.""Inspector Javert," replied M. Madeleine, "the highest law isconscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.""And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.""Then content yourself with obeying.""I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve sixmonths in prison."M. Madeleine replied gently:--"Heed this well; she will not serve a single day."At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on themayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundlyrespectful:--"I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in mylife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of myauthority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to thequestion of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herselfon Monsieur Bamatabnois, who is an elector and the proprietor of thathandsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there arein the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question ofpolice regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detainthis woman Fantine."Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which noone in the town had heard hitherto:--"The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipalpolice. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, andsixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I orderthat this woman shall be set at liberty."Javert ventured to make a final effort."But, Mr. Mayor--""I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.""Monsieur le Maire, permit me--""Not another word.""But--""Leave the room," said M. Madeleine.Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, likea Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and leftthe room.Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as hepassed.Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had justseen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She hadseen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul,her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawingher towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light.In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these twomen had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon,the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and,strange to say, that which made her shudder from head to foot wasthe fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom sheabhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of allher woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insultedhim in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, beenmistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not know; shetrembled. She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in affright, andat every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades ofhatred crumble and melt within her, and something warm and ineffable,indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and love, dawn in herheart.When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and saidto her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish toweep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:--"I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. Ibelieve that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorantof the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? Buthere; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall goto her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertakethe care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer ifyou do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall behonest and happy once more. And listen! I declare to you that if allis as you say,--and I do not doubt it,--you have never ceased to bevirtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman."This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave thislife of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; tosee all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst ofher misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, andcould only give vent to two or three sobs, "Oh! Oh! Oh!"Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, andbefore he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press herlips to it.Then she fainted.BOOK SIXTH.--JAVERTCHAPTER I--THE BEGINNING OF REPOSEM. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he hadestablished in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who puther to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the nightin delirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some onebreathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M.Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. Hisgaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed itsdirection, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed tothe wall.Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine's eyes. He seemedto her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. Shegazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At lastshe said timidly:--"What are you doing?"M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantineto awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:--"How do you feel?""Well, I have slept," she replied; "I think that I am better, It isnothing."He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to himas though he had just heard it:--"I was praying to the martyr there on high."And he added in his own mind, "For the martyr here below."M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries.He knew all now. He knew Fantine's history in all its heart-rendingdetails. He went on:--"You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now havethe dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels.It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise.You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form ofheaven. It was necessary to begin there."He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in whichtwo teeth were lacking.That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted ithimself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and thesuperscription ran: To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur lePrefet of Police. As the affair in the station-house had been bruitedabout, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letterbefore it was sent off, and who recognized Javert's handwriting on thecover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thenardiers. Fantine owedthem one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs,telling them to pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the childinstantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.This dazzled Thenardier. "The devil!" said the man to his wife; "don'tlet's allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milchcow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother."He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some oddfrancs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over threehundred francs,--one for the doctor, the other for the apothecarywho had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two longillnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It wasonly a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of thememorandum Thenardier wrote, Received on account, three hundred francs.M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote,"Make haste to bring Cosette.""Christi!" said Thenardier, "let's not give up the child."In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in theinfirmary.The sisters had at first only received and nursed "that woman" withrepugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recallthe inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey thefoolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae isone of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sistersfelt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few daysFantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things,and the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heardher say amid her fever: "I have been a sinner; but when I have my childbeside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I wasleading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me;I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her sakethat I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel thebenediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her;it will do me good to see that innocent creature. She knows nothing atall. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings havenot fallen off."M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:--"Shall I see my Cosette soon?"He answered:--"To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her."And the mother's pale face grew radiant."Oh!" she said, "how happy I am going to be!"We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary,her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. Thathandful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades hadbrought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence ofwhich the malady which had been smouldering within her for many yearswas violently developed at last. At that time people were beginning tofollow the fine Laennec's fine suggestions in the study and treatment ofchest maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine's chest and shook his head.M. Madeleine said to the doctor:--"Well?""Has she not a child which she desires to see?" said the doctor."Yes.""Well! Make haste and get it here!"M. Madeleine shuddered.Fantine inquired:--"What did the doctor say?"M. Madeleine forced himself to smile."He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that wouldrestore your health.""Oh!" she rejoined, "he is right! But what do those Thenardiers meanby keeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I beholdhappiness close beside me!"In the meantime Thenardier did not "let go of the child," and gave ahundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enoughto take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained somepetty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collectingthe bills for them, etc., etc."I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!" said Father Madeleine. "Ifnecessary, I will go myself."He wrote the following letter to Fantine's dictation, and made her signit:-- "MONSIEUR THENARDIER:--          You will deliver Cosette to this person.          You will be paid for all the little things.          I have the honor to salute you with respect.                                                  "FANTINE."In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will themysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destinyconstantly reappears in it.CHAPTER II--HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMPOne morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging inadvance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office, in casehe should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informedthat Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him.Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearingthis name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of thepolice-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him."Admit him," he said.Javert entered.M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyesfixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and whichcontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction ofpolice regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert's account. Hecould not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacialin his manner.Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turnedto him. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating thisdocket.Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, withoutbreaking the silence.If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who hadmade a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization,this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and thecorporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, this unspotted policeagent--if any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherishedaversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject ofFantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have said tohimself, "What has taken place?" It was evident to any one acquaintedwith that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferociousconscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great interiorstruggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in hiscountenance. Like violent people in general, he was subject to abruptchanges of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar andstartling. On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in whichthere was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces inthe rear of the mayor's arm-chair, and there he stood, perfectly erect,in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughnessof a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient; hewaited without uttering a word, without making a movement, in genuinehumility and tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat in hand, witheyes cast down, and an expression which was half-way between that of asoldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presenceof his judge, until it should please the mayor to turn round. All thesentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributedto him had disappeared. That face, as impenetrable and simple asgranite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholydepression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and anindescribable courageous despondency.At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round."Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?"Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas,then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not,however, preclude simplicity."This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.""What act?""An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in thegravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact toyour knowledge, as it is my duty to do.""Who is the agent?" asked M. Madeleine."I," said Javert."You?""I.""And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?""You, Mr. Mayor."M. Madeleine sat erect in his arm-chair. Javert went on, with a severeair and his eyes still cast down."Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities todismiss me."M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:--"You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that doesnot suffice. Handing in one's resignation is honorable. I have failed inmy duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out."And after a pause he added:--"Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be soto-day, with justice.""Come, now! Why?" exclaimed M. Madeleine. "What nonsense is this?What is the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty oftowards me? What have you done to me? What are your wrongs with regardto me? You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded--""Turned out," said Javert."Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.""You shall understand, Mr. Mayor."Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, stillcoldly and sadly:--"Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,I was furious, and I informed against you.""Informed against me!""At the Prefecture of Police in Paris."M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener thanJavert himself, burst out laughing now:--"As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?""As an ex-convict."The mayor turned livid.Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:--"I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strengthof your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill inmarksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;--I hardly know whatall,--absurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain JeanValjean.""A certain--What did you say the name was?""Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twentyyears ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On leavingthe galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then hecommitted another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highwayon the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, noone knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I did thisthing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!"M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments beforethis, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:--"And what reply did you receive?""That I was mad.""Well?""Well, they were right.""It is lucky that you recognize the fact.""I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found."The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from hishand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with hisindescribable accent:--"Ah!"Javert continued:--"This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in theneighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was calledFather Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid anyattention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, lastautumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some ciderapples from--Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled,branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still hadthe branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up tothis point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is whereProvidence intervened."The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds itconvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmentalprison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict namedBrevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointedturnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner hadChampmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: 'Eh! Why, I know that man!He is a fagot![4] Take a good look at me, my good man! You are JeanValjean!' 'Jean Valjean! who's Jean Valjean?' Champmathieu feignsastonishment. 'Don't play the innocent dodge,' says Brevet. 'You areJean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twentyyears ago; we were there together.' Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! Youunderstand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated forme. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirtyyears ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably atFaverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards hewas seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have beena wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but thathas not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for theft, whatwas Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact.This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's surname wasMathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from thegalleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose ofconcealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes toAuvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan--he is calledChan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformedinto Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made atFaverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is notknown where they have gone. You know that among those classes a familyoften disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When suchpeople are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of thestory dates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolleswho knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet,there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean;they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life.They are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretendedChampmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as wellas for Brevet. The same age,--he is fifty-four,--the same height, thesame air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at thismoment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. Iwas told that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras,in the power of the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprisedme, when I thought that I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write tothe examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me--""Well?" interposed M. Madeleine.Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:--"Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is JeanValjean. I recognized him also."M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:--"You are sure?"Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes fromprofound conviction."O! Sure!"He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches ofpowdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on thetable, and he added:--"And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how Icould have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor."Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man,who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the wholestation-house, and bade him "leave the room,"--Javert, that haughty man,was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,--M. Madeleine made noother reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:--"And what does this man say?""Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it's a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, hehas his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break abranch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for aman it is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbingand housebreaking--it is all there. It is no longer a question ofcorrectional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is nolonger a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life. Andthen, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will return, Ihope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is there not?Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. Thatis the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that thingswere getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out--thekettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, etcetera. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, 'I amChampmathieu, and I won't depart from that!' He has an astonished air,he pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever! Butit makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been recognized byfour persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been takento the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my testimony. I havebeen summoned."M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, andwas turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns,like a busy man. He turned to Javert:--"That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me butlittle. We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand.Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the womanBuseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. Youwill tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter PierreChesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman andher child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay,Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on theadjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and isundermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verifythe infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me inthe Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at MadameRenee le Bosse's, and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you agreat deal of work. Are you not to be absent? Did you not tell me thatyou were going to Arras on that matter in a week or ten days?""Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.""On what day, then?""Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case wasto be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night."M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement."And how long will the case last?""One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow eveningat latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; Ishall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.""That is well," said M. Madeleine.And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.Javert did not withdraw."Excuse me, Mr. Mayor," said he."What is it now?" demanded M. Madeleine."Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.""What is it?""That I must be dismissed."M. Madeleine rose."Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate yourfault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, youdeserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain yourpost."Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths hisnot very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, andsaid in a tranquil voice:--"Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.""I repeat," replied M. Madeleine, "that the matter concerns me."But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:--"So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is theway I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is ourright to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above ourselvesis an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the objectof wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict, you, arespectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious. Ihave insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities!If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I should havedeclared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? Stop,Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in the course of mylife towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were notsevere towards myself, all the justice that I have done would becomeinjustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I shouldbe good for nothing but to chastise others, and not myself! Why, Ishould be a blackguard! Those who say, 'That blackguard of a Javert!'would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that you should treatme kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it wasdirected to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness whichconsists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the policeagent against the mayor, the man who is down against the man who isup in the world, is what I call false kindness. That is the sort ofkindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it is very easy to bekind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if you had been what Ithought you, I should not have been kind to you, not I! You would haveseen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat any other man.When I have subdued malefactors, when I have proceeded with vigoragainst rascals, I have often said to myself, 'If you flinch, if I evercatch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!' I have flinched, Ihave caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged,cashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I will till the soil; itmakes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good of the service demands anexample. I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert."All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced tone,which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man."We shall see," said M. Madeleine.And he offered him his hand.Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:--"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer hishand to a police spy."He added between his teeth:--"A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I amno more than a police spy."Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:--"Mr. Mayor," he said, "I shall continue to serve until I am superseded."He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.BOOK SEVENTH.--THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIRCHAPTER I--SISTER SIMPLICEThe incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M. surM. But the small portion of them which became known left such a memoryin that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we didnot narrate them in their most minute details. Among these details thereader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which wepreserve out of respect for the truth.On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to seeFantine according to his wont.Before entering Fantine's room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of SisterPerpetue and Sister Simplice.Sister Perpetue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in acoarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters any otherservice. She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is notso very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasantearthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. Thetransition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent;the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorancecommon to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand,and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a littlemore amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpetuewas a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois,droned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or thehypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, wascrabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned theirdeath agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpetue,she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely tracedthe features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in whichhe mingles as much freedom as servitude: "They shall have for theirconvent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; forchapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of thetown and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; forgratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty." This ideal wasrealized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never beenyoung, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one couldhave told Sister Simplice's age. She was a person--we dare not say awoman--who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied.She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid thangranite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pureand fine. There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said justwhat was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which wouldhave equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. Thisdelicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harshcontact a continual reminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasizeone detail. Never to have lied, never to have said, for any interestwhatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not thetruth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive trait; it wasthe accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the congregationfor this imperturbable veracity. The Abbe Sicard speaks of SisterSimplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincerewe may be, we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little, innocentlie. She did not. Little lie, innocent lie--does such a thing exist? Tolie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not possible: hewho lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon.Satan has two names; he is called Satan and Lying. That is what shethought; and as she thought, so she did. The result was the whitenesswhich we have mentioned--a whiteness which covered even her lips and hereyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her glance was white. There wasnot a single spider's web, not a grain of dust, on the glass window ofthat conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she hadtaken the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as weknow, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be tornoff rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta when she hadbeen born at Syracuse--a lie which would have saved her. This patronsaint suited this soul.Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faultswhich she had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and sheliked to receive letters. She never read anything but a book of prayersprinted in Latin, in coarse type. She did not understand Latin, but sheunderstood the book.This pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probablyfeeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almostexclusively to her care.M. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to herin a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.Fantine awaited M. Madeleine's appearance every day as one awaits a rayof warmth and joy. She said to the sisters, "I only live when Monsieurle Maire is here."She had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw M. Madeleineshe asked him:--"And Cosette?"He replied with a smile:--"Soon."M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained anhour instead of half an hour, to Fantine's great delight. He urged everyone repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It wasnoticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre.But this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bentdown to his ear and said to him, "She is losing ground fast."Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed himattentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study. Hewrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.CHAPTER II--THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIREFrom the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to aFleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out "horsesand cabriolets as desired."In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take thelittle-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of theparish in which M. Madeleine resided. The cure was, it was said, aworthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleinearrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in thestreet, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed thepriest's house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, andretraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an ironknocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; thenhe paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and afterthe lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fallabruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of hastewhich had not been apparent previously.M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching aharness over."Master Scaufflaire," he inquired, "have you a good horse?""Mr. Mayor," said the Fleming, "all my horses are good. What do you meanby a good horse?""I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.""The deuce!" said the Fleming. "Twenty leagues!""Yes.""Hitched to a cabriolet?""Yes.""And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?""He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.""To traverse the same road?""Yes.""The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?"M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilledsome figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8 1/2."You see," he said, "total, nineteen and a half; as well say twentyleagues.""Mr. Mayor," returned the Fleming, "I have just what you want. My littlewhite horse--you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a smallbeast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to makea saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laideverybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no oneknew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage.That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like thewind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas tobe a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. 'Draw? Yes. Carry? No.'We must suppose that is what he said to himself.""And he will accomplish the trip?""Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours.But here are the conditions.""State them.""In the first place, you will give him half an hour's breathing spellmidway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he iseating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; forI have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stablemen than eaten by the horses.""Some one will be by.""In the second place--is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?""Yes.""Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?""Yes.""Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in ordernot to overload the horse?""Agreed.""But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obligedto take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.""That is understood.""I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid foralso--not a farthing less; and the beast's food to be at Monsieur leMaire's expense."M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on thetable."Here is the pay for two days in advance.""Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and wouldfatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a littletilbury that I own.""I consent to that.""It is light, but it has no cover.""That makes no difference to me.""Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?"M. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:--"That it is very cold?"M. Madeleine preserved silence.Master Scaufflaire continued:--"That it may rain?"M. Madeleine raised his head and said:--"The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morningat half-past four o'clock.""Of course, Monsieur le Maire," replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching aspeck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with thatcareless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle withtheir shrewdness:--"But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not toldme where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?"He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of theconversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put thequestion."Are your horse's forelegs good?" said M. Madeleine."Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going downhill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you aregoing?""Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o'clockto-morrow morning," replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.The Fleming remained "utterly stupid," as he himself said some timeafterwards.The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again;it was the mayor once more.He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air."Monsieur Scaufflaire," said he, "at what sum do you estimate the valueof the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,--the one bearingthe other?""The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire," said the Fleming, witha broad smile."So be it. Well?""Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?""No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me backthe sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse andcabriolet?""Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.""Here it is."M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and thistime he did not return.Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said athousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but ahundred crowns.The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. "Where thedevil could Monsieur le Maire be going?" They held counsel together."He is going to Paris," said the wife. "I don't believe it," said thehusband.M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it layon the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. "Five,six, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays." Heturned to his wife:--"I have found out.""What?""It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol,eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras."Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest wayto return from Master Scaufflaire's, as though the parsonage door hadbeen a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascendedto his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of thefactory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine's only servant, noticedthat the latter's light was extinguished at half-past eight, and shementioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:--"Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air."This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine'schamber. He paid no heed to the portress's words, but went to bed andto sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he hadheard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing backand forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. Helistened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine's step. Thisstruck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine'schamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier hearda noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shutagain; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of alighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of therays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine's chamber. Thereflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which hadbeen lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was notshown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that thiswindow was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fellasleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step wasstill passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale andpeaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window wasstill open.This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine's room.CHAPTER III--A TEMPEST IN A SKULLThe reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no otherthan Jean Valjean.We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment hasnow come when we must take another look into it. We do so not withoutemotion and trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in existencethan this sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere findmore dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it can fix itselfon no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, moremysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than thesea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it isthe inmost recesses of the soul.To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference toa single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, wouldbe to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscienceis the chaos of chimeras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace ofdreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemoniumof sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, atcertain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engagedin reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into thatobscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of giants,like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons andhydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as inDante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears withinhim, and which he measures with despair against the caprices of hisbrain and the actions of his life!Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which hehesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Letus enter, nevertheless.We have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what hadhappened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. Fromthat moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. Whatthe Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was morethan a transformation; it was a transfiguration.He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving onlythe candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversedFrance, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safefrom seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. surM., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the firsthalf of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassuredand hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,--to conceal his nameand to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind thatthey formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing andimperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspiredto regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the samethings. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the readerwill remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M.Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second--hissecurity to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all hisprudence, he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning forhim, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed thatway, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, andsaved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations ofJavert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought,following the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and just,that his first duty was not towards himself.At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yetpresented itself.Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferingswe are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood thisconfusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, whichhe had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated,he was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinistereccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt thatshudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approachof a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He feltshadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head.As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was togo, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prisonand place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as anincision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said tohimself, "We will see! We will see!" He repressed this first, generousinstinct, and recoiled before heroism.It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop's holy words, afterso many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitenceadmirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even inthe presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk withthe same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of whichlay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus. We mustrender an account of the things which went on in this soul, and we canonly tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first, bythe instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in haste,stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert's presence, thatgreat danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shookoff thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as awarrior picks up his buckler.He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwindwithin, a profound tranquillity without. He took no "preservativemeasures," as they may be called. Everything was still confused, andjostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he couldnot perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could havetold nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.He repaired to Fantine's bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged hisvisit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behavethus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should beobliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might beobliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world madeup his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was,beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of theway in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged thetilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.He dined with a good deal of appetite.On returning to his room, he communed with himself.He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedentedthat in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair, moved by someinexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He fearedlest something more should enter. He was barricading himself againstpossibilities.A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.It seemed to him as though he might be seen.By whom?Alas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered;that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,--hisconscience.His conscience; that is to say, God.Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of securityand of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he tookpossession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his headon his hand, and began to meditate in the dark."Where do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it reallytrue that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in thatmanner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is itpossible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so farfrom suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? Whatis there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?"This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost itspower of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched hisbrow in both hands to arrest them.Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmedhis will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw proof andresolution.His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.There were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at thetable.The first hour passed in this manner.Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fixthemselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse withprecision of the reality,--not the whole situation, but some ofthe details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical andextraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.This only caused an increase of his stupor.Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned tohis actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but ahole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most ofall in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was toever hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that wouldbe the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name madeits reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from abouthim, and--who knows?--perhaps even his new soul within him, also. Heshuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if anyone had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when thatname would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, wouldsuddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when thatformidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he hadenveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and thatthat name would not menace him, that that light would but producean obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase themystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that thisprodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he wasconcerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering hisexistence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of hisconfrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthycitizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful, andmore respected than ever--if any one had told him that, he would havetossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, allthis was precisely what had just come to pass; all that accumulation ofimpossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these wild fancies tobecome real things!His revery continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to anunderstanding of his position.It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicabledream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middleof the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the verybrink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger,a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and whom shewas thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf mightclose once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or that otherman, should fall into it: he had only let things take their course.The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: Thathis place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was stillawaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to it;that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he filledit; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to himself,"that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared that acertain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards himself,being present in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, presentin society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear,provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head ofthat Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the stone of thesepulchre, falls once, never to rise again."All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took placein him that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than twoor three times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of theconscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart, whichis composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be called anoutburst of inward laughter.He hastily relighted his candle."Well, what then?" he said to himself; "what am I afraid of? What isthere in all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I hadbut one partly open door through which my past might invade my life,and behold that door is walled up forever! That Javert, who has beenannoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed to have divinedme, which had divined me--good God! and which followed me everywhere;that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrownoff the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail:henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has his JeanValjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to leave town!And all this has been brought about without any aid from me, and I countfor nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon myhonor, people would think, to see me, that some catastrophe had happenedto me! After all, if it does bring harm to some one, that is not myfault in the least: it is Providence which has done it all; it isbecause it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the right to disarrangewhat it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should I meddle? It doesnot concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what more do I want? Thegoal to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream of my nights,the object of my prayers to Heaven,--security,--I have now attained; itis God who wills it; I can do nothing against the will of God, and whydoes God will it? In order that I may continue what I have begun, that Imay do good, that I may one day be a grand and encouraging example, thatit may be said at last, that a little happiness has been attached tothe penance which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I havereturned. Really, I do not understand why I was afraid, a little whileago, to enter the house of that good cure, and to ask his advice; thisis evidently what he would have said to me: It is settled; let thingstake their course; let the good God do as he likes!"Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, bendingover what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair, and beganto pace the room: "Come," said he, "let us think no more about it; myresolve is taken!" but he felt no joy.Quite the reverse.One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one canthe sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; theguilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed thegloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened, sayingthat which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened to that whichhe would have preferred not to hear, yielding to that mysterious powerwhich said to him: "Think!" as it said to another condemned man, twothousand years ago, "March on!"Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fullyunderstood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no livingbeing who has not done it. It may even be said that the word is nevera more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to consciencewithin a man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is inthis sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, hesaid, he exclaimed, must be understood; one speaks to one's self, talksto one's self, exclaims to one's self without breaking the externalsilence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talks except themouth. The realities of the soul are none the less realities becausethey are not visible and palpable.So he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that"settled resolve." He confessed to himself that all that he had justarranged in his mind was monstrous, that "to let things take theircourse, to let the good God do as he liked," was simply horrible; toallow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinder it,to lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short,was to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the lastdegree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted thebitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.He spit it out with disgust.He continued to question himself. He asked himself severely what he hadmeant by this, "My object is attained!" He declared to himself thathis life really had an object; but what object? To conceal his name?To deceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done allthat he had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was thetrue one--to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest andgood once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that alone,which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him--toshut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he wasre-opening it by committing an infamous action! He was becoming a thiefonce more, and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another ofhis existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He wasbecoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretchedman. He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, that deathbeneath the open sky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand,to surrender himself to save that man, struck down with so melancholyan error, to resume his own name, to become once more, out of duty, theconvict Jean Valjean, that was, in truth, to achieve his resurrection,and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged; to fall backthere in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This must bedone! He had done nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life wasuseless; all his penitence was wasted. There was no longer any need ofsaying, "What is the use?" He felt that the Bishop was there, that theBishop was present all the more because he was dead, that the Bishopwas gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all hisvirtues, would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjeanwould be pure and admirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, butthat the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishopbeheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, deliver the false JeanValjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was the greatest ofsacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take; butit must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyesof God when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men."Well," said he, "let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let ussave this man." He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that hewas speaking aloud.He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung inthe fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassedtradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it mighthave been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment,To Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d'Artois, Paris. He drew from hissecretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and thepassport of which he had made use that same year when he went to theelections.Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts,into which there entered such grave thought, would have had no suspicionof what was going on within him. Only occasionally did his lips move; atother times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of thewall, as though there existed at that point something which he wished toelucidate or interrogate.When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into hispocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.His revery had not swerved from its course. He continued to see his dutyclearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyes andchanged its place as he altered the direction of his glance:--"Go! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!"In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him invisible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formedthe double rule of his soul,--the concealment of his name, thesanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him asabsolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated them.He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, good,while the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, andthat the other was personality; that the one said, my neighbor, and thatthe other said, myself; that one emanated from the light, and the otherfrom darkness.They were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion ashe meditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had nowattained colossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld withinhimself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in themidst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thoughtwas getting the upper hand.He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of hisconscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the firstphase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. Afterthe grand crisis, the grand test.But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possessionof him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued tofortify him in his resolution.One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the mattertoo keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, andthat he had actually been guilty of theft.He answered himself: "If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, thatmeans a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. Andwho knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of Jean Valjeanoverwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not the attorneysfor the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is supposed to be athief because he is known to be a convict."In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when hedenounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken intoconsideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and what hehad done for the district, and that they would have mercy on him.But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as heremembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put himin the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction,that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to the preciseterms of the law, would render him liable to penal servitude for life.He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more fromearth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himselfthat he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappyafter doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he allowedthings to take their own course, if he remained at M. sur M., hisconsideration, his good name, his good works, the deference andveneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, hisvirtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste ofall these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, ifhe accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled withthe galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,and pitiless shame.At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thusallotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made onhigh, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without andabomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage tofail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, ofindifferent matters, in spite of himself.The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the soundsof the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a fewdays previously, he had seen in an ironmonger's shop an ancient clockfor sale, upon which was written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to closethe window.In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to makea tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of histhoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing this."Ah! yes," he said to himself, "I had resolved to inform againstmyself."And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine."Hold!" said he, "and what about that poor woman?"Here a fresh crisis declared itself.Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced the effectof an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everythingabout him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:--"Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper forme to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person orto save my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or aninfamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothingbut I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse formsof egotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think alittle about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come,let us examine the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_forgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denouncemyself? I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back inthe galleys; that is well--and what then? What is going on here? Ah!here is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers,both men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this Ihave created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere wherethere is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on thehearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed withlife, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lackingme, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and thiswoman, who has suffered so much, who possesses so many merits in spiteof her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! Andthat child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to hermother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation forthe evil which I have done her? If I disappear, what happens? The motherdies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will take place, ifI denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, let us see how itwill be if I do not denounce myself."After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergoa momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, and heanswered himself calmly:--"Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the deuce!he has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has not been guiltyof theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall havemade ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing ofmy own; what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am doing it;the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused andanimated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, a hundredfamilies, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomespopulated; villages spring up where there were only farms before;farms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, andwith wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vicesdisappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and beholda whole country rich and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd!what was that I was saying about denouncing myself? I really must payattention and not be precipitate about anything. What! because it wouldhave pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama, afterall; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! forthe sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps,but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a good-for-nothing,evidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor woman must die inthe hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street! like dogs; ah,this is abominable! And without the mother even having seen her childonce more, almost without the child's having known her mother; andall that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, mostassuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if not forthat; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice theinnocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live atmost, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel,and which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. Thispoor little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, nodoubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thenardiers;those peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect my duty towardsall these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself; and Iwas about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst:suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that myconscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good ofothers, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil actionwhich compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in thatalone there is virtue."He rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths arefound only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, afterhaving descended into these depths, after having long groped among thedarkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds,one of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he wasdazzled as he gazed upon it."Yes," he thought, "this is right; I am on the right road; I have thesolution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken;let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us nolonger hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I amMadeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!I am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything; itturns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let himlook out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal name whichwas floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a head, somuch the worse for that head."He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, andsaid:--"Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another mannow."He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short."Come!" he said, "I must not flinch before any of the consequences ofthe resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads whichattach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very roomthere are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bearwitness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear."He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out asmall key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardlybe seen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design whichcovered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort offalse cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and thechimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags--a blue linenblouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorncudgel shod with iron at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Valjean atthe epoch when he passed through D----in October, 1815, could easilyhave recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, inorder to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but hehad concealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed thecandlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that itwould open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quickand abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, withoutbestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiouslyand so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all, rags,cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.[Illustration: Candlesticks Into the Fire  1b7-3-into-the-fire]He closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the doorbehind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall werelighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was on fire;the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of thechamber.As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which itcontained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By bendingover, one could have readily recognized a coin,--no doubt the forty-soupiece stolen from the little Savoyard.He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the samestep.All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shonevaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow."Hold!" he thought; "the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. Theymust be destroyed also."He seized the two candlesticks.There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape,and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a senseof real comfort. "How good warmth is!" said he.He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.A minute more, and they were both in the fire.At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within himshouting: "Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!"His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to someterrible thing."Yes, that's it! finish!" said the voice. "Complete what you are about!Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop!Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right! Applaudyourself! So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed: here is an old manwho does not know what is wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing,an innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies in your name, upon whomyour name weighs like a crime, who is about to be taken for you, whowill be condemned, who will finish his days in abjectness and horror.That is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le Maire;remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent;rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during thistime, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be aman who will wear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy,and who will drag your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arrangedthus. Ah, wretch!"The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on thecandlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished. Thevoice continued:--"Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make agreat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, andonly one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark.Well! listen, infamous man! All those benedictions will fall back beforethey reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God."This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the mostobscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling andformidable, and he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him thatit had detached itself from him, and that it was now speaking outsideof him. He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that heglanced around the room in a sort of terror."Is there any one here?" he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:--"How stupid I am! There can be no one!"There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom thehuman eye cannot see.He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled thedreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him.It sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved aboutfor the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounterby change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knewhis position.He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which hehad arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to himequally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieushould have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the meanswhich Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen hisposition!There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,great God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all thathe should be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take uponce more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was sogood, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty.He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never more hear thebirds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on thelittle children; he should never more experience the sweetness of havingglances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he should quit that housewhich he had built, that little chamber! Everything seemed charming tohim at that moment. Never again should he read those books; never moreshould he write on that little table of white wood; his old portress,the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffeein the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the ironnecklet, the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell,the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well! At his age,after having been what he was! If he were only young again! but tobe addressed in his old age as "thou" by any one who pleased; tobe searched by the convict-guard; to receive the galley-sergeant'scudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare feet; to have tostretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman whovisits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would betold: "That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor ofM. sur M."; and at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed withlassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two bytwo, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip.Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligentbeing, and become as monstrous as the human heart?And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemmawhich lay at the foundation of his revery: "Should he remain in paradiseand become a demon? Should he return to hell and become an angel?"What was to be done? Great God! what was to be done?The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty wasunchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused oncemore; they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which ispeculiar to despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to hismind, with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past.He thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where younglovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little childwho is permitted to toddle alone.At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to recoverthe mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time,and definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallenprostrate with fatigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he to holdhis peace? He could not manage to see anything distinctly. The vagueaspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out byhis meditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into smoke.He only felt that, to whatever course of action he made up his mind,something in him must die, and that of necessity, and without his beingable to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on theright hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a deathagony,--the agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.Alas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. He was nofurther advanced than at the beginning.Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen hundredyears before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom aresummed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had alsolong thrust aside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered inthe wild wind of the infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Himdripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths allstudded with stars.CHAPTER IV--FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEPThree o'clock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walkingthus for five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he at length allowedhimself to drop into his chair.There he fell asleep and had a dream.This dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to thesituation, except by its painful and heart-rending character, but itmade an impression on him. This nightmare struck him so forcibly that hewrote it down later on. It is one of the papers in his own handwritingwhich he has bequeathed to us. We think that we have here reproduced thething in strict accordance with the text.Of whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night wouldbe incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of anailing soul.Here it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, "The Dream Ihad that Night.""I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. Itdid not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night."I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years,the brother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardlyremember."We were conversing and we met some passers-by. We were talking of aneighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her windowopen from the time when she came to live on the street. As we talked wefelt cold because of that open window."There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. Hewas entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which wasearth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the veinson it. In his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine-shootand as heavy as iron. This horseman passed and said nothing to us."My brother said to me, 'Let us take to the hollow road.'"There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nora spear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. Afterproceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceivedthat my brother was no longer with me."I entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must beRomainville. (Why Romainville?)[5]"The first street that I entered was deserted. I entered a secondstreet. Behind the angle formed by the two streets, a man was standingerect against the wall. I said to this Man:--"'What country is this? Where am I?' The man made no reply. I saw thedoor of a house open, and I entered."The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the doorof this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired ofthis man, 'Whose house is this? Where am I?' The man replied not."The house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden.The garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standingupright. I said to this man, 'What garden is this? Where am I?' The mandid not answer."I strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. Allthe streets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single livingbeing was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers orstrolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behindeach door, behind each tree, stood a silent man. Only one was to be seenat a time. These men watched me pass."I left the town and began to ramble about the fields."After the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd comingup behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town.They had strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet theywalked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In aninstant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of thesemen were earthen in hue."Then the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the townsaid to me:--"'Whither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead thislong time?'"I opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one nearme."He woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze of dawnwas rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on theirhinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing its end. It was stillblack night.He rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even yet.From his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. Asharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from theearth.Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened andshortened in a singular manner through the darkness.As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, "Hold!"said he, "there are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now."But this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first rousedhim thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two starswere the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he wasable to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessedto a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the tramplingof the horse's hoofs on the pavement."What vehicle is this?" he said to himself. "Who is coming here so earlyin the morning?"At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.He shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:--"Who is there?"Some one said:--"I, Monsieur le Maire."He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress."Well!" he replied, "what is it?""Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o'clock in the morning.""What is that to me?""The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.""What cabriolet?""The tilbury.""What tilbury?""Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?""No," said he."The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.""What coachman?""M. Scaufflaire's coachman.""M. Scaufflaire?"That name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning hadpassed in front of his face."Ah! yes," he resumed; "M. Scaufflaire!"If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have beenfrightened.A tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candlewith a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burningwax, which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman waited for him.She even ventured to uplift her voice once more:--"What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?""Say that it is well, and that I am coming down."CHAPTER V--HINDRANCESThe posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at thisperiod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagonswere two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-coloredleather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy,the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long,offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance, and whichmay still be seen on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immenseoblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it.This coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had somethingdistorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing inthe distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembledthe insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though withbut little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelledat a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at oneo'clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M.sur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning.That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdinroad, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering thetown, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was goingin the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a manenveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violentshock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid noheed and pursued his road at full gallop."That man is in a devilish hurry!" said the postman.The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen strugglingin convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening?He did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither?To Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well.At times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into thenight as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew himon. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every onewill understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least oncein his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan,done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.Why was he going to Arras?He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hiredScaufflaire's cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there wasno reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of mattersfor himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what tookplace; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed andscrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, somewretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow himto go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts whohad known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;--bah! what anidea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; thatall conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, andthat there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;that accordingly there was no danger.That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it;that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in hisown hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go toArras.Nevertheless, he was going thither.As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at thatfine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a halfan hour.In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within himdraw back.At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay farbehind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all thechilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes,but without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as theevening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and bymeans of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these blacksilhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister qualityto the violent state of his soul.Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimesborder on the highway, he said to himself, "And yet there are peoplethere within who are sleeping!"The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road,produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when oneis joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front ofthe inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him givensome oats.The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of theBoulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neckand shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, finelegs, and solid hoofs--a homely, but a robust and healthy race. Theexcellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not adrop of sweat on his loins.He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oatssuddenly bent down and examined the left wheel."Are you going far in this condition?" said the man.He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his revery:--"Why?""Have you come from a great distance?" went on the man."Five leagues.""Ah!""Why do you say, 'Ah?'"The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyesfixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:--"Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainlywill not travel another quarter of a league."He sprang out of the tilbury."What is that you say, my friend?""I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagueswithout you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Justsee here!"The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered bythe mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that thenut no longer held firm."My friend," he said to the stableman, "is there a wheelwright here?""Certainly, sir.""Do me the service to go and fetch him.""He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!"Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold.He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when thelatter thinks a limb is broken."Can you repair this wheel immediately?""Yes, sir.""When can I set out again?""To-morrow.""To-morrow!""There is a long day's work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?""In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest.""Impossible, sir.""I will pay whatever you ask.""Impossible.""Well, in two hours, then.""Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur willnot be able to start before to-morrow morning.""The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replacethis wheel instead of repairing it?""How so?""You are a wheelwright?""Certainly, sir.""Have you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again atonce.""A spare wheel?""Yes.""I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels makea pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.""In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.""Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.""Try, nevertheless.""It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are buta poor country here.""Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?"The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was ahired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders."You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, Iwould not let it to you!""Well, sell it to me, then.""I have none.""What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see.""We live in a poor country. There is, in truth," added the wheelwright,"an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois ofthe town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on thethirty-sixth of the month--never, that is to say. I might let thatto you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see itpass--and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses.""I will take two post-horses.""Where is Monsieur going?""To Arras.""And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?""Yes, of course.""By taking two post-horses?""Why not?""Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clockto-morrow morning?""Certainly not.""There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by takingpost-horses--Monsieur has his passport?""Yes.""Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras beforeto-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly served, thehorses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning;heavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, fromthe post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or fourhours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk.There are many hills to ascend.""Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some onecan surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.""Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?""That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.""Then--""But I can surely hire a horse in the village?""A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?""Yes.""That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. Youwould have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But youwill not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for athousand.""What am I to do?""The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, andset out on your journey to-morrow.""To-morrow will be too late.""The deuce!""Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?""To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as theone coming.""What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?""A day, and a good long one.""If you set two men to work?""If I set ten men to work.""What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?""That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly isin a bad state, too.""Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?""No.""Is there another wheelwright?"The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of thehead."No."He felt an immense joy.It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who hadbroken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road.He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made everypossible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulouslyexhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, norfatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproachhimself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did notconcern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act ofhis own conscience, but the act of Providence.He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of hislungs for the first time since Javert's visit. It seemed to him that thehand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twentyhours had just released him.It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.He said himself that he had done all he could, and that now he hadnothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamberof the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him,things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should nothave had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is aboutto peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Anycolloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are alwayspeople who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he wasquestioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and forthhalted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, towhom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ranoff.At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which wehave just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child returned.He was accompanied by an old woman."Monsieur," said the woman, "my boy tells me that you wish to hire acabriolet."These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made theperspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the handwhich had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, readyto seize him once more.He answered:--"Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire."And he hastened to add:--"But there is none in the place.""Certainly there is," said the old woman."Where?" interpolated the wheelwright."At my house," replied the old woman.He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart.The wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of thetraveller escaping their clutches, interfered."It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actualfact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the raincame into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; itwould not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle oldstage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trustedhimself to it," etc., etc.All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, thisthing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to berepaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horseput to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had beentravelling since morning.At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, amoment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should notgo whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort ofwrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back?After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one wasforcing him to it.And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: "Stop! Stop!" Hehalted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish andconvulsive element resembling hope.It was the old woman's little boy."Monsieur," said the latter, "it was I who got the cart for you.""Well?""You have not given me anything."He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almostodious."Ah! it's you, you scamp?" said he; "you shall have nothing."He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good.The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was themonth of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then,it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition,there were many ascents.He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours forfive leagues.At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came toand led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood besidethe manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusingthings.The inn-keeper's wife came to the stable."Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?""Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite."He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to thepublic room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth."Make haste!" said he; "I must start again; I am in a hurry."A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; helooked at the girl with a sensation of comfort."That is what ailed me," he thought; "I had not breakfasted."His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and thenslowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:--"Why is their bread so bitter here?"The carter was a German and did not understand him.He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his coursetowards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in themorning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fieldspass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of theroad, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimessuffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is moremelancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for thefirst and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at everyinstant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did makecomparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: allthe things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark andbright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse;we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing;each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feela shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomyhorse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled andunknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of schoolbeheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were stillshort; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, alaborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and saidto him:--"That horse is very much fatigued."The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk."Are you going to Arras?" added the road-mender."Yes.""If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early."He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:--"How far is it from here to Arras?""Nearly seven good leagues.""How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.""Ah!" returned the road-mender, "so you don't know that the road isunder repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;there is no way to proceed further.""Really?""You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will crossthe river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that isthe road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads to Arras.""But it is night, and I shall lose my way.""You do not belong in these parts?""No.""And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir," resumed theroad-mender; "shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired;return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reachArras to-morrow.""I must be there this evening.""That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extrahorse; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads."He followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, and, half anhour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,was seated on the shaft of the cariole.Still, he felt that he had lost time.Night had fully come.They turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully bad; thecart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:--"Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee."In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke."There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir," said the postilion; "I don'tknow how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; ifyou wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras earlyto-morrow morning."He replied, "Have you a bit of rope and a knife?""Yes, sir."He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at agallop.The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over thehills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleamsin the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced asound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture;everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror. How manythings shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before;he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain inthe neighborhood of D----, eight years previously, and it seemed butyesterday.The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:--"What time is it?""Seven o'clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but threeleagues still to go."At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: thatall this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he didnot know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straightahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; thenhe sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, thesittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning;that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples wouldbe very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity,four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; thathe should arrive after all was over.The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and leftMont-Saint-Eloy behind them.The night grew more profound.CHAPTER VI--SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOFBut at that moment Fantine was joyous.She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her feverhad doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when thedoctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look,and ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaitsin her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculationswhich seemed to be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow andstaring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted upagain and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of acertain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting thelight of earth.Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she repliedinvariably, "Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine."Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost herlast modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow ofherself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering hadcompleted the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twentyhad a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from whichthe gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominentshoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair wasgrowing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!At mid-day the physician returned, gave some directions, inquiredwhether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shookhis head.M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock. Asexactness is kindness, he was exact.About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course oftwenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, "What time is it,sister?"Three o'clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; shewho could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshlesshands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter oneof those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantineturned and looked at the door.No one entered; the door did not open.She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on thedoor, motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared notspeak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell backon her pillow.She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clockstruck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell backagain.Her thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she madeno complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way.One would have said that something dark was descending upon her. She waslivid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.Five o'clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently,"He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow."Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine's delay.In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. Sheseemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began tosing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is whatFantine was singing:--          "Lovely things we will buy           As we stroll the faubourgs through.           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue."Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantleclad, and said to me, 'Here, hide 'neath my veil the child whom youone day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buythread.'          "Lovely things we will buy           As we stroll the faubourgs through."Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbonsdecked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou hastgranted me. 'Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?'--'Make of itclothes for thy new-born babe.'          "Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,           I love my love, and corn-flowers are blue."'Wash this linen.'--'Where?'--'In the stream. Make of it, soilingnot, spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I willembroider and fill with flowers.'--'Madame, the child is no longer here;what is to be done?'--'Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to buryme.'          "Lovely things we will buy           As we stroll the faubourgs through,           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue."This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days,lulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to hermind in all the five years during which she had been parted from herchild. She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that itwas enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed asshe was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.The clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longerseemed to pay attention to anything about her.Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of thefactory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to theinfirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that themayor had set out that morning before six o'clock, in a little tilburyharnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gonealone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken;that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; thatothers asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when hewent away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely toldthe portress not to expect him that night.While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turnedto Fantine's bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, whichunite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation ofdeath, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled handsresting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of thecurtains, and was listening. All at once she cried:--"You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What ishe doing? Why does he not come?"Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heardthe voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright."Answer me!" cried Fantine.The servant stammered:--"The portress told me that he could not come to-day.""Be calm, my child," said the sister; "lie down again."Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, andwith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:--"He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it toeach other there. I want to know it."The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun's ear, "Say that he is busywith the city council."Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid hadproposed to her.On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of thetruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, andthat this was a serious matter in Fantine's present state. Her flushdid not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, andsaid, "Monsieur le Maire has gone away."Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyessparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face."Gone!" she cried; "he has gone to get Cosette."Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable;her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.When her prayer was finished, "Sister," she said, "I am willing to liedown again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I begyour pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly;I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: thegood God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone toMontfermeil to get my little Cosette."She lay down again, with the nun's assistance, helped the nun to arrangeher pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on herneck, and which Sister Simplice had given her."My child," said the sister, "try to rest now, and do not talk anymore."Fantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands, and the latter waspained to feel that perspiration."He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go throughParis; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do youremember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette,Soon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign aletter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers; they cannotsay anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have beenpaid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since theyhave received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk,sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all anymore; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it isnearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how muchattached one gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you willsee! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In thefirst place, she will have very beautiful hands; she had ridiculoushands when she was only a year old; like this! she must be a big girlnow; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady; I call herCosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I waslooking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea comeacross me, like that, that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu!how wrong it is not to see one's children for years! One ought toreflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! itis very cold! it is true; he had on his cloak, at least? he will behere to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be a festival day; to-morrowmorning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that haslace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I took that journey onfoot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go very quickly!he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from here toMontfermeil?"The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, "Oh, I think that hewill be here to-morrow.""To-morrow! to-morrow!" said Fantine, "I shall see Cosette to-morrow!you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad;I could dance if any one wished it."A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not haveunderstood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively andnatural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked,she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile."Well," resumed the nun, "now that you are happy, mind me, and do nottalk any more."Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: "Yes,lie down again; be good, for you are going to have your child; SisterSimplice is right; every one here is right."And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began tostare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she saidnothing more.The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she wouldfall into a doze. Between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came; nothearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, andapproached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, bythe light of the taper, he saw Fantine's big eyes gazing at him.She said to him, "She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a littlebed, will she not, sir?"The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:--"See! there is just room."The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him;that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubtthey had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed thatthe mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, thather guess was correct: the doctor approved.He returned to Fantine's bed, and she went on:--"You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say goodmorning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I canhear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.""Give me your hand," said the doctor.She stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:--"Ah, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette willarrive to-morrow."The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chesthad decreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life hadsuddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature."Doctor," she went on, "did the sister tell you that M. le Maire hasgone to get that mite of a child?"The doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should beavoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case thefever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As hetook his departure, he said to the sister:--"She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor shouldactually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crisesso astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know wellthat this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all thosethings are such mysteries: we may be able to save her."CHAPTER VII--THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FORDEPARTUREIt was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, which weleft on the road, entered the porte-cochere of the Hotel de la Poste inArras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alightedfrom it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of thepeople of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own handsled the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of abilliard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there,and leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours forthe journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself thejustice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he wasnot sorry.The landlady of the hotel entered."Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?"He made a sign of the head in the negative."The stableman says that Monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued."Here he broke his silence."Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrowmorning?""Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least."He inquired:--"Is not the posting-station located here?""Yes, sir."The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, andinquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to bevacant; he engaged it and paid for it. "Monsieur," said the clerk,"do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in themorning."This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and hewalked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of thepassers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in alabyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passingalong with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to thisman, not without having first glanced behind and in front of him, asthough he feared lest some one should hear the question which he wasabout to put."Monsieur," said he, "where is the court-house, if you please.""You do not belong in town, sir?" replied the bourgeois, who was anoldish man; "well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction ofthe court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of theprefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at thismoment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in theprefecture.""Is it there that the Assizes are held?" he asked."Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop'spalace before the Revolution. M. de Conzie, who was bishop in '82, builta grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held."On the way, the bourgeois said to him:--"If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittingsgenerally close at six o'clock."When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out tohim four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomybuilding."Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do yousee those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is lightthere, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatlyprotracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take aninterest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?"He replied:--"I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of thelawyers.""That is different," said the bourgeois. "Stop, sir; here is the doorwhere the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase."He conformed to the bourgeois's directions, and a few minutes later hewas in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingledwith lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of menrobed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold ofthe halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcomeof these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likelyto be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtfulobserver so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concertall sorts of dark edifices.This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall ofthe episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palaceof justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment,separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyerwhom he met."What stage have they reached, sir?" he asked."It is finished," said the lawyer."Finished!"This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round."Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?""No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?""Of course. Nothing else was possible.""To penal servitude?""For life."He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:--"Then his identity was established?""What identity?" replied the lawyer. "There was no identity to beestablished. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered herchild; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question ofpremeditation, and she was condemned for life.""So it was a woman?" said he."Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?""Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is stilllighted?""For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.""What other case?""Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard;a man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty oftheft. I don't know his name exactly. There's a bandit's phiz for you!I'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.""Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?" said he."I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However,the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when thehearing is resumed, you might make an effort.""Where is the entrance?""Through yonder large door."The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possibleemotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, piercedhis heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw thatnothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not havetold whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. Thedocket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointedfor the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with theinfanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the"return horse." This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear tobe entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already beenin the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect tohis case. However, the man's examination and the depositions of thewitnesses had been completed, but the lawyer's plea, and the speechof the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not befinished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; theattorney-general was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he wasa brilliant fellow who wrote verses.An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.He inquired of this usher:--"Will the door be opened soon, sir?""It will not be opened at all," replied the usher."What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not thehearing suspended?""The hearing has just been begun again," replied the usher, "but thedoor will not be opened again.""Why?""Because the hall is full.""What! There is not room for one more?""Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now."The usher added after a pause: "There are, to tell the truth, twoor three extra places behind Monsieur le President, but Monsieur lePresident only admits public functionaries to them."So saying, the usher turned his back.He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowlydescended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probablethat he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which hadbeen going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended;and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching thelanding-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded hisarms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, tookfrom it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly,by the light of the street lantern, this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M.sur M.; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, madehis way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed himthe paper, and said in an authoritative manner:--"Take this to Monsieur le President."The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.CHAPTER VIII--AN ENTRANCE BY FAVORAlthough he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyeda sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation forvirtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passedthe confines of a small district and had been spread abroad throughtwo or three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he hadrendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of thearrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for somebenefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply theindustries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, whenoccasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linenfactory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frevent, and thehydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere thename of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douaienvied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over thissession of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the restof the world, with this name which was so profoundly and universallyhonored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connectedthe council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of thePresident's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribedthe line which we have just perused, adding: "The gentleman desires tobe present at the trial," the President, with a quick and deferentialmovement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paperand returned it to the usher, saying, "Admit him."The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the doorof the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the usherhad left him. In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying tohim, "Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?" It was the same usherwho had turned his back upon him but a moment previously, and who wasnow bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handedhim the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light,he could read it."The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.Madeleine."He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for hima strange and bitter aftertaste.He followed the usher.A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscotedcabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon atable with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had justquitted him still rang in his ears: "Monsieur, you are now in thecouncil-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door,and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the President'schair." These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory ofnarrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed.The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He soughtto collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the momentwhen there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painfulrealities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain. Hewas in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned. Withstupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment,where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with hisname, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He stared atthe wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be thatchamber and that it should be he.He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by thejolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him thathe felt nothing.He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and whichcontained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean NicolasPache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, nodoubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded tothe commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them.Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who hadwatched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck himas very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and he read ittwo or three times. He read it without paying any attention to it, andunconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knobof the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almostforgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there, remainedfixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by littlebecame impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth amonghis hair and trickled down upon his temples.At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort ofauthority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and whichdoes so well convey, "Pardieu! who compels me to this?" Then he wheeledbriskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had entered infront of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was no longerin that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor,broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lightedhere and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, thecorridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he listened; nota sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as though pursued.When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. Thesame silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He wasout of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone wascold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himselfup with a shiver.Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and withsomething else, too, perchance, he meditated.He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heardwithin him but one voice, which said, "Alas!"A quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighedwith agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly,and as though crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him inhis flight and was leading him back.He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight ofwas the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polishedbrass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lambmight gaze into the eye of a tiger.He could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a stepand approached the door.Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining halllike a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did nothear.Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself nearthe door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.He was in the court-room.CHAPTER IX--A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATIONHe advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, andremained standing, contemplating what he saw.It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now fullof silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its pettyand mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process ofdevelopment.At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, withabstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails orclosing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers inall sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient,spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that wasyellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-roomlamps which emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails inthe wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere andaugust impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which iscalled the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances weredirected towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a smalldoor, in the stretch of wall on the President's left; on this bench,illuminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.This man was the man.He did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, asthough they had known beforehand where that figure was.He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the samein face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with hisbristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just asit was on the day when he entered D----, full of hatred, concealinghis soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spentnineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.He said to himself with a shudder, "Good God! shall I become like thatagain?"This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was somethingindescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to makeway for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding thatthe personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he hadbowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M.sur M., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once,recognized him and saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he wasthe victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all thesehe had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before;he had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; theymoved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirageof his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a realcrowd, and real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld themonstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him,with all that there is formidable in reality.All this was yawning before him.He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepestrecesses of his soul, "Never!"And by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, andrendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! allcalled that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.Under his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representationof the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night,the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all were thesame, only above the President's head there hung a crucifix, somethingwhich the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: God hadbeen absent when he had been judged.There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at thethought that he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage ofa pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge's desk, to concealhis face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; hehad fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually herecovered; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible tolisten.M. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.He looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses washidden from him by the clerk's table, and then, as we have just said,the hall was sparely lighted.At the moment of this entrance, the defendant's lawyer had just finishedhis plea.The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair hadlasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching astrange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupidor profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terriblelikeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who hadbeen found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, brokenin the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was thisman? an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and theywere unanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; theaccusation said: "We have in our grasp not only a marauder, a stealerof fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender whohas broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerousdescription, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long beenin search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleysat Toulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, on theperson of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime providedfor by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for whichwe reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have been judiciallyestablished. He has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of asecond offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later on he will bejudged for the old crime." In the face of this accusation, in the faceof the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonishedmore than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant toconvey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty,replied with embarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, wasa denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged inorder of battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of thissociety which was seizing fast upon him; nevertheless, it was a questionof the most menacing future for him; the likeness increased everymoment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he didhimself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which descendedever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibilityafforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case hisidentity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to endthereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of hisapathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or didhe not understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd,and seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible andpuzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was alsoobscure.The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in thatprovincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar,and which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as atRomorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, isno longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whomit is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majesticstride; a tongue in which a husband is called a consort, and a womana spouse; Paris, the centre of art and civilization; the king,the monarch; Monseigneur the Bishop, a sainted pontiff; thedistrict-attorney, the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution; thearguments, the accents which we have just listened to; the age of LouisXIV., the grand age; a theatre, the temple of Melpomene; the reigningfamily, the august blood of our kings; a concert, a musical solemnity;the General Commandant of the province, the illustrious warrior, who,etc.; the pupils in the seminary, these tender levities; errors imputedto newspapers, the imposture which distills its venom through thecolumns of those organs; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with anexplanation as to the theft of the apples,--an awkward matter couchedin fine style; but Benigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to achicken in the midst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himselffrom the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the factthat the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved.His client, whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in callingChampmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking thatbranch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyerpreferred to call a bough) in his possession; but he said that he hadfound it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had beenbroken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown awayby the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there had been athief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief had beenChampmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. Thelawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily,well attested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused hadexercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieumight well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,--inshort, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and withouthesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to thistestimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of hisclient, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he wasthe convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of theapples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The prisoner,it was true, and his counsel, "in good faith," was obliged to admit it,had adopted "a bad system of defence." He obstinately denied everything,the theft and his character of convict. An admission upon this lastpoint would certainly have been better, and would have won for him theindulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do this; butthe accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that he wouldsave everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but ought not thepaucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration? This manwas visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, longmisery outside the galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himselfbadly; was that a reason for condemning him? As for the affair withLittle Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it; it did not enter intothe case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court, ifthe identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to applyto him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who hasbroken his ban, and not the frightful chastisement which descends uponthe convict guilty of a second offence.The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He wasviolent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his "loyalty," andskilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused throughall the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admitthat the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this manwas Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation andcould no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a cleverautonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, thedistrict-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romanticschool, then dawning under the name of the Satanic school, whichhad been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and theOriflamme; he attributed, not without some probability, to the influenceof this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather,to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted theseconsiderations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was this JeanValjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth, etc.The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale ofTheramene, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day rendersgreat services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury"shuddered." The description finished, the district-attorney resumedwith an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of thejournal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: Andit is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means ofexistence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, andbut little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by thecrime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man,caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from awall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the objectstolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denieseverything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundredother proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognizehim--Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three ofhis former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, andCochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelmingunanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemenof the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, theaccused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in whichsome admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised thata man could talk like that. From time to time, at those "energetic"moments of the prosecutor's speech, when eloquence which cannot containitself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops theaccused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left andfrom left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with whichhe had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two orthree times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say ina low voice, "That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup." Thedistrict-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupidattitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but craft,skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all itsnakedness the "profound perversity" of this man. He ended by makinghis reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severesentence.At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude forlife.The counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieurl'Avocat-General on his "admirable speech," then replied as best hecould; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away fromunder his feet.CHAPTER X--THE SYSTEM OF DENIALSThe moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had theaccused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, "Have youanything to add to your defence?"The man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in hishands a terrible cap which he had.The President repeated the question.This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motionlike a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared atthe audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laidhis monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench,took another look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon thedistrict-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an eruption.It seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from hismouth,--incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,--asthough they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:--"This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris,and that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In thewheelwright's trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,because space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that onebeats one's arms together to warm one's self; but the masters don't likeit; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice betweenthe paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is oldwhile he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for.I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean!When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing but an old bird,old beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid meas little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age--and then Ihad my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She earned a littlealso. It sufficed for us two. She had trouble, also; all day long up toher waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, whenit freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash. There are peoplewho have not much linen, and wait until late; if you do not wash, youlose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and water drops on youfrom everywhere; you have your petticoats all damp above and below. Thatpenetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges,where the water comes through faucets. You are not in the tub there; youwash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in a basin behind you. Asit is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there is that hot steam, whichis terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She came home at seven o'clockin the evening, and went to bed at once, she was so tired. Her husbandbeat her. She is dead. We have not been very happy. She was a good girl,who did not go to the ball, and who was very peaceable. I rememberone Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock. There, I amtelling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Parisis a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, Itell you. Go see at M. Baloup's; and after all, I don't know what iswanted of me."The man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these thingsin a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and savageingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sortof affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random camelike hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a wood-cutter who issplitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into a laugh.He stared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, andnot understanding why, he began to laugh himself.It was inauspicious.The President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.He reminded "the gentlemen of the jury" that "the sieur Baloup, formerlya master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served,had been summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not to befound." Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to whathe was about to say, and added: "You are in a position where reflectionis necessary. The gravest presumptions rest upon you, and may inducevital results. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you for thelast time to explain yourself clearly on two points. In the first place,did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, breakthe branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit the crimeof breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the dischargedconvict, Jean Valjean--yes or no?"The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who hasthoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make. Heopened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:--"In the first place--"Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace."Prisoner," said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; "payattention. You are not answering anything that has been asked of you.Your embarrassment condemns you. It is evident that your name is notChampmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed firstunder the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; thatyou went to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you werea pruner of trees. It is evident that you have been guilty of entering,and of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemenof the jury will form their own opinion."[Illustration: Father Champmathieu on Trial]The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when thedistrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:--"You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I couldnot find words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man whodoes not have something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; Iwas walking through the country after a shower, which had made the wholecountry yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing sprang fromthe sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside. Ifound a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branchwithout knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have been inprison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three months;more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me,'Answer!' The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and saysto me in a low voice, 'Come, answer!' I don't know how to explain; Ihave no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, becausethey do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the groundthings that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! Idon't know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for M. Baloup,Boulevard de l'Hopital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very clever totell me where I was born; I don't know myself: it's not everybodywho has a house in which to come into the world; that would be tooconvenient. I think that my father and mother were people who strolledalong the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child,they called me young fellow; now they call me old fellow; those are mybaptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in Auvergne; I havebeen at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can't a man have been in Auvergne, orat Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I tell you that Ihave not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I have been with M.Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me with your nonsense,there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?"The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed thePresident:--"Monsieur le President, in view of the confused but exceedingly cleverdenials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot,but who will not succeed in so doing,--we shall attend to that,--wedemand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court tosummon once more into this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, andChenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question them for the lasttime as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean.""I would remind the district-attorney," said the President, "thatPolice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of aneighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon ashe had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with theconsent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.""That is true, Mr. President," responded the district-attorney. "In theabsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen ofthe jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimableman, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior butimportant functions. These are the terms of his deposition: 'I do noteven stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions togive the lie to the prisoner's denial. I recognize him perfectly. Thename of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named JeanValjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is only withextreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. Heunderwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five orsix attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and fromthe Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house ofHis Grace the late Bishop of D---- I often saw him at the time when Iwas adjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat thatI recognize him perfectly.'"This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impressionon the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded byinsisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,Chenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnlyinterrogated.The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,the door of the witnesses' room opened. The usher, accompanied by agendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convictBrevet. The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as thoughthey had contained but one soul.The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the centralprisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort ofbusiness man's face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes gotogether. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had becomesomething in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his superiorssaid, "He tries to make himself of use." The chaplains bore goodtestimony as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten that thispassed under the Restoration."Brevet," said the President, "you have undergone an ignominioussentence, and you cannot take an oath."Brevet dropped his eyes."Nevertheless," continued the President, "even in the man whom the lawhas degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, asentiment of honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that Iappeal at this decisive hour. If it still exists in you,--and I hopeit does,--reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, thisman, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which aword from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still timeto retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet,take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us onyour soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as yourformer companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?"Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court."Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick toit; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left in1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must bebecause age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognizehim positively.""Take your seat," said the President. "Prisoner, remain standing."Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by hisred cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at thegalleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was asmall man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs andhis whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions inthe galleys had nicknamed him I-deny-God (Je-nie Dieu, Chenildieu).The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he hadused to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy whichdeprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised hishead and looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him toreflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted inrecognition of the prisoner.Chenildieu burst out laughing."Pardieu, as if I didn't recognize him! We were attached to the samechain for five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?""Go take your seat," said the President.The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, whohad come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, wasa peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guardedthe flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped intoa brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupidthan the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature hassketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishingtouches as convicts in the galleys.The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,and asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, withouthesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing beforehim."He is Jean Valjean," said Cochepaille. "He was even calledJean-the-Screw, because he was so strong."Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere andin good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for theprisoner,--a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that afresh declaration was added to the proceeding.The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at thefirst, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between histeeth: "Ah, well, he's a nice one!" after the second, he said, a littlelouder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, "Good!" at thethird, he cried, "Famous!"The President addressed him:--"Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?"He replied:--"I say, 'Famous!'"An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to thejury; it was evident that the man was lost."Ushers," said the President, "enforce silence! I am going to sum up thearguments."At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voicewas heard crying:--"Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!"All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible wasit; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man,placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind thecourt, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated thetribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the hall;the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty persons,recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:--"M. Madeleine!"CHAPTER XI--CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHEDIt was he, in fact. The clerk's lamp illumined his countenance. He heldhis hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coatwas carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly;his hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was nowentirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there wasa momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been soheart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they didnot understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeeduttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had beenthe one to give that terrible outcry.This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the Presidentand the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and thegendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at thatmoment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,Brevet, and Chenildieu."Do you not recognize me?" said he.All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head thatthey did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a militarysalute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court, and said ina gentle voice:--"Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr.President, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in searchof; it is I: I am Jean Valjean."Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had beenfollowed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hallexperienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses whensomething grand has been done.In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy andsadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and afew low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public,and asked in accents which all understood:--"Is there a physician present?"The district-attorney took the word:--"Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incidentwhich disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with asentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, byreputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.;if there is a physician in the audience, we join the President inrequesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to hishome."M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; heinterrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are thewords which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were writtendown, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene,and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly fortyyears ago:--"I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see;you were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! Iam fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only onehere who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God,who is on high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and thatsuffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; Iconcealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have becomea mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems thatthat is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I cannottell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear itone of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it istrue that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you thatJean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogetherhis fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so greatlyhumbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence,nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy from which Ihave tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys make the convictwhat he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before going to thegalleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little intelligence, a sortof idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I becamevicious: I was a block of wood; I became a firebrand. Later on,indulgence and kindness saved me, as severity had ruined me. But, pardonme, you cannot understand what I am saying. You will find at my house,among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole,seven years ago, from little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add;take me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, 'M.Madeleine has gone mad!' you do not believe me! that is distressing. Donot, at least, condemn this man! What! these men do not recognize me! Iwish Javert were here; he would recognize me."Nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone whichaccompanied these words.He turned to the three convicts, and said:--"Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?"He paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:--"Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which youwore in the galleys?"Brevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot witha frightened air. He continued:--"Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of 'Jenie-Dieu,'your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laidyour shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to effacethe three letters T. F. P., which are still visible, nevertheless;answer, is this true?""It is true," said Chenildieu.He addressed himself to Cochepaille:--"Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stampedin blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing ofthe Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!"Cochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and onhis bare arm.A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.The unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smilewhich still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think ofit. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair."You see plainly," he said, "that I am Jean Valjean."In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, norgendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts.No one recalled any longer the part that each might be called uponto play; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose ofprosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel forthe defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstancethat no question was put, that no authority intervened. The peculiarityof sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls and turn witnessesinto spectators. No one, probably, could have explained what he felt;no one, probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendidoutburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That wasclear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with lightthat matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, withoutany further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electricrevelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simpleand magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up sothat another man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, thehesitations, little possible oppositions, were swallowed up in that vastand luminous fact.It was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was irresistibleat the moment."I do not wish to disturb the court further," resumed Jean Valjean. "Ishall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do.The district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; hecan have me arrested when he likes."He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not anarm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there wasabout him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand asideand make way for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was neverknown who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the door openwhen he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:--"I am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney."Then he addressed the audience:--"All of you, all who are present--consider me worthy of pity, do younot? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, Iconsider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferrednot to have had this occur."He withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for thosewho do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by someone in the crowd.Less than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the saidChampmathieu from all accusations; and Champmathieu, being at oncereleased, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all menwere fools, and comprehending nothing of this vision.BOOK EIGHTH.--A COUNTER-BLOWCHAPTER I--IN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIRThe day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverishnight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. SisterSimplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of thisslumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sisterhad been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bendingover her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, onaccount of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over allobjects. Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek. M.Madeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently."Is it you, Mr. Mayor?" she exclaimed.He replied in a low voice:--"How is that poor woman?""Not so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy."She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill theday before, and that she was better now, because she thought that themayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared notquestion the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he hadnot come from there."All that is good," said he; "you were right not to undeceive her.""Yes," responded the sister; "but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you andwill not see her child. What shall we say to her?"He reflected for a moment."God will inspire us," said he."But we cannot tell a lie," murmured the sister, half aloud.It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine'sface. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it."Good God, sir!" she exclaimed; "what has happened to you? Your hair isperfectly white!""White!" said he.Sister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled outthe little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whethera patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine tookthe mirror, looked at his hair, and said:--"Well!"He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were onsomething else.The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught aglimpse in all this.He inquired:--"Can I see her?""Is not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?"said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question."Of course; but it will take two or three days at least.""If she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time," went onthe sister, timidly, "she would not know that Monsieur le Maire hadreturned, and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and whenthe child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had justcome with the child. We should not have to enact a lie."M. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with hiscalm gravity:--"No, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste."The nun did not appear to notice this word "perhaps," which communicatedan obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech. Shereplied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:--"In that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter."He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise ofwhich might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine's chamber,approached the bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Herbreath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiarto those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they arewatching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemnedto death. But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort ofineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, and whichtransfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness; hercheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of heryouth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though theyremained closed and drooping. Her whole person was trembling with anindescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear heraway, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not beseen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she wasan invalid whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rathersomething on the point of soaring away than something on the point ofdying.The branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, andseems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time.The human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives inwhich the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.M. Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazingin turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two monthsbefore, on the day when he had come for the first time to see herin that asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude--shesleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hairwas gray and his was white.The sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with hisfinger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom hemust enjoin to silence.She opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:--"And Cosette?"CHAPTER II--FANTINE HAPPYShe made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.That simple question, "And Cosette?" was put with so profound a faith,with so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and ofdoubt, that he found not a word of reply. She continued:--"I knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seenyou for a long, long time. I have been following you with my eyes allnight long. You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts ofcelestial forms."He raised his glance to the crucifix."But," she resumed, "tell me where Cosette is. Why did not you place heron my bed against the moment of my waking?"He made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able torecall.Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his appearance.He came to the aid of M. Madeleine."Calm yourself, my child," said the doctor; "your child is here."Fantine's eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light. She claspedher hands with an expression which contained all that is possible toprayer in the way of violence and tenderness."Oh!" she exclaimed, "bring her to me!"Touching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the littlechild who is carried."Not yet," said the doctor, "not just now. You still have some fever.The sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm. You must becured first."She interrupted him impetuously:--"But I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass that doctoris! The idea! I want to see my child!""You see," said the doctor, "how excited you become. So long as you arein this state I shall oppose your having your child. It is not enoughto see her; it is necessary that you should live for her. When you arereasonable, I will bring her to you myself."The poor mother bowed her head."I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I shouldnever have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes have happenedto me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying. I understand you;you fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like, but I swear toyou that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter. I have beenseeing her; I have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening.Do you know? If she were brought to me now, I should talk to her verygently. That is all. Is it not quite natural that I should desire to seemy daughter, who has been brought to me expressly from Montfermeil? Iam not angry. I know well that I am about to be happy. All night long Ihave seen white things, and persons who smiled at me. When Monsieur leDocteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette. I have no longer any fever;I am well. I am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matterwith me any more; but I am going to behave as though I were ill, and notstir, to please these ladies here. When it is seen that I am very calm,they will say, 'She must have her child.'"M. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towardshim; she was making a visible effort to be calm and "very good," as sheexpressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, inorder that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty aboutbringing Cosette to her. But while she controlled herself she could notrefrain from questioning M. Madeleine."Did you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good you wereto go and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand thejourney well? Alas! she will not recognize me. She must have forgottenme by this time, poor darling! Children have no memories. They are likebirds. A child sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, andthinks of nothing any longer. And did she have white linen? Did thoseThenardiers keep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knewhow I have suffered, putting such questions as that to myself during allthe time of my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how Ishould like to see her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le Maire?Is not my daughter beautiful? You must have been very cold in thatdiligence! Could she not be brought for just one little instant? Shemight be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the master; itcould be so if you chose!"He took her hand. "Cosette is beautiful," he said, "Cosette is well.You shall see her soon; but calm yourself; you are talking with too muchvivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes, andthat makes you cough."In fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word.Fantine did not murmur; she feared that she had injured by her toopassionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous ofinspiring, and she began to talk of indifferent things."Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasureparties in summer. Are the Thenardiers prosperous? There are not manytravellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a cook-shop."M. Madeleine was still holding her hand, and gazing at her with anxiety;it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mindnow hesitated. The doctor, having finished his visit, retired. SisterSimplice remained alone with them.But in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:--"I hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!"She stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath,and began to listen with rapture.There was a child playing in the yard--the child of the portress orof some work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are alwaysoccurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage-settingof mournful scenes. The child--a little girl--was going and coming,running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her voice.Alas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It was thislittle girl whom Fantine heard singing."Oh!" she resumed, "it is my Cosette! I recognize her voice."The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantinelistened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M.Madeleine heard her say, in a low voice: "How wicked that doctor is notto allow me to see my daughter! That man has an evil countenance, thathe has."But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. Shecontinued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: "Howhappy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very firstthing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in thegarden. She must know her letters by this time. I will make her spell.She will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Thenshe will take her first communion. Ah! when will she take her firstcommunion?"She began to reckon on her fingers."One, two, three, four--she is seven years old. In five years she willhave a white veil, and openwork stockings; she will look like a littlewoman. O my good sister, you do not know how foolish I become when Ithink of my daughter's first communion!"She began to laugh.He had released Fantine's hand. He listened to her words as one listensto the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mindabsorbed in reflection which had no bottom. All at once she ceasedspeaking, and this caused him to raise his head mechanically. Fantinehad become terrible.She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself toa sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her face,which had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and sheseemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on somethingalarming at the other extremity of the room."Good God!" he exclaimed; "what ails you, Fantine?"She made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object whichshe seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the othermade him a sign to look behind him.He turned, and beheld Javert.CHAPTER III--JAVERT SATISFIEDThis is what had taken place.The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quittedthe Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to setout again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A littlebefore six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and hisfirst care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter theinfirmary and see Fantine.However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court ofAssizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock,had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor ofM. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the leastmodified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter,and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney'spersistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, ofthe public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defencehad some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that,in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, ofthe real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughlyaltered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocentman. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh,unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, in hissumming up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutesthe jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean;and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, thedistrict-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred "asto the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M."This phrase, in which there was a great deal of of, is thedistrict-attorney's, written with his own hand, on the minutes of hisreport to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, thePresident did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, takeits course. And then, when all was said, although the President wasa kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, adevoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hearthe Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alludingto the landing at Cannes.The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. Thedistrict-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, atfull speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately afterhaving given his deposition.Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him theorder of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, intwo words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The orderof arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:"Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayorof M. sur M., who, in this day's session of the court, was recognized asthe liberated convict, Jean Valjean."Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at themoment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could havedivined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his airthe most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his grayhair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mountedthe stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughlyacquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment,would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under hisleft ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwontedagitation.Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty orin his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons ofhis coat.That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it wasindispensable that there should have taken place in him one of thoseemotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboringpost for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in thecourtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed out to him by the portress,who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed meninquiring for the mayor.On arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushedthe door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, andentered.Properly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-opendoor, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, whichwas buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head ofhis enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence beingperceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M.Madeleine turn round.The instant that Madeleine's glance encountered Javert's glance, Javert,without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him,became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all thatwas in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having beenstirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, insome slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a fewmoments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by prideat having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and ofhaving for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert's content shoneforth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspreadthat narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfiedface can afford were there.Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearlyto himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of hispresence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, andtruth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him andaround him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the casejudged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; hewas protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders,he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute,he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed in hisvictory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant,he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferociousarchangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishingcaused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenchedfist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion,perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and therewas an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are thingswhich may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even whenhideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the humanconscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtueswhich have one vice,--error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanaticin the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriouslyvenerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in hisformidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man whotriumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face,wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of thegood.CHAPTER IV--AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTSFantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had tornher from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the onlything which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her. She couldnot endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her; she hidher face in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:--"Monsieur Madeleine, save me!"Jean Valjean--we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise--had risen.He said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:--"Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come."Then he addressed Javert, and said:--"I know what you want."Javert replied:--"Be quick about it!"There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these wordssomething indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, "Bequick about it!" he said "Bequiabouit."No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered:it was no longer a human word: it was a roar.He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into thematter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjeanwas a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon,a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last fiveyears, without being able to throw him. This arrest was not a beginning,but an end. He confined himself to saying, "Be quick about it!"As he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at JeanValjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and withwhich he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrowof her bones two months previously.At Javert's exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But themayor was there; what had she to fear?Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:--"See here now! Art thou coming?"The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting thenun and the mayor. To whom could that abject use of "thou" be addressed?To her only. She shuddered.Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedentedthat nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackestdeliriums of fever.She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; shesaw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was comingto an end.Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar."Monsieur le Maire!" shrieked Fantine.Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed allhis gums."There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!"Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped thecollar of his coat. He said:--"Javert--"Javert interrupted him: "Call me Mr. Inspector.""Monsieur," said Jean Valjean, "I should like to say a word to you inprivate.""Aloud! Say it aloud!" replied Javert; "people are in the habit oftalking aloud to me."Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:--"I have a request to make of you--""I tell you to speak loud.""But you alone should hear it--""What difference does that make to me? I shall not listen."Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very lowvoice:--"Grant me three days' grace! three days in which to go and fetch thechild of this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You shallaccompany me if you choose.""You are making sport of me!" cried Javert. "Come now, I did not thinkyou such a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run away!You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature's child!Ah! Ah! That's good! That's really capital!"Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling."My child!" she cried, "to go and fetch my child! She is not here,then! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! MonsieurMadeleine! Monsieur le Maire!"Javert stamped his foot."And now there's the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy?It's a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and wherewomen of the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going tochange all that; it is high time!"He stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into hisgrasp Jean Valjean's cravat, shirt and collar:--"I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is noMonsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named JeanValjean! And I have him in my grasp! That's what there is!"Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on herstiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazedat Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though tospeak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teethchattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her handsconvulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; thensuddenly fell back on her pillow.Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on herbreast, with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.She was dead.Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and openedit as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:--"You have murdered that woman.""Let's have an end of this!" shouted Javert, in a fury; "I am not hereto listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below;march on instantly, or you'll get the thumb-screws!"In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in adecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bedwhen they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to thisbed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in adilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped theprincipal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreatedtowards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walkedslowly up to Fantine's couch. When he arrived there he turned and saidto Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:--"I advise you not to disturb me at this moment."One thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might availhimself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, graspedhis cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, withoutremoving his eyes from Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, andhis brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body ofFantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed,evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressiblepity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,and spoke to her in a low voice.What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say tothat woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heardthem. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusionswhich are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which thereexists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of theincident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered inFantine's ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on thosepale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.Jean Valjean took Fantine's head in both his hands, and arranged it onthe pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied thestring of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. Thatdone, he closed her eyes.Fantine's face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.Fantine's hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean kneltdown before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.Then he rose, and turned to Javert."Now," said he, "I am at your disposal."CHAPTER V--A SUITABLE TOMBJavert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, anextraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot concealthe fact, that at the single word, "He was a convict," nearly every onedeserted him. In less than two hours all the good that he had done hadbeen forgotten, and he was nothing but a "convict from the galleys." Itis just to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras werenot yet known. All day long conversations like the following were to beheard in all quarters of the town:--"You don't know? He was a liberated convict!" "Who?" "The mayor." "Bah!M. Madeleine?" "Yes." "Really?" "His name was not Madeleine at all; hehad a frightful name, Bejean, Bojean, Boujean." "Ah! Good God!" "Hehas been arrested." "Arrested!" "In prison, in the city prison, whilewaiting to be transferred." "Until he is transferred!" "He is to betransferred!" "Where is he to be taken?" "He will be tried at theAssizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago." "Well! Isuspected as much. That man was too good, too perfect, too affected.He refused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he cameacross. I always thought there was some evil history back of all that."The "drawing-rooms" particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.One old lady, a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc, made the followingremark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:--"I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!"It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanishedfrom M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remainedfaithful to his memory. The old portress who had served him was amongthe number.On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in herlodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections.The factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, thestreet was deserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns,Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the bodyof Fantine.Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home,the good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key ofM. Madeleine's chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used everyevening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nailwhence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on oneside, as though she was expecting him. Then she sat down again on herchair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, good oldwoman had done all this without being conscious of it.It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself fromher revery, and exclaimed, "Hold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his keyon the nail!"At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passedthrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper atthe candle which was burning there.The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and ashriek which she confined to her throat.She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.It was M. Madeleine.It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a seizure, as shesaid herself, when she related the adventure afterwards."Good God, Monsieur le Maire," she cried at last, "I thought you were--"She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking inrespect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maireto her.He finished her thought."In prison," said he. "I was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows;I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going upto my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with that poorwoman, no doubt."The old woman obeyed in all haste.He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him betterthan he should guard himself.No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyardwithout opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him,a pass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have beensearched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This pointwas never explained.He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at thetop, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his doorwith very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters byfeeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window couldbe seen from the street.He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed whichhad not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of thenight before last remained. The portress had "done up" his room; onlyshe had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the twoiron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackenedby the fire.He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: "These are the two tips ofmy iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes," and he arranged this pieceof paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they werethe first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard hepulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In thestrips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. Hebetrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up theBishop's candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It wasprobably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the roomwhen the authorities made an examination later on.There came two taps at the door."Come in," said he.It was Sister Simplice.She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembledin her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, thathowever polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from ourvery bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions ofthat day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, andshe was trembling.Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which hehanded to the nun, saying, "Sister, you will give this to Monsieur leCure."The paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it."You can read it," said he.She read:--"I beg Monsieur le Cure to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. Hewill be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of thefuneral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor."The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a fewinarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:--"Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,unhappy woman?""No," said he; "I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me inthat room, and that would disturb her."He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on thestaircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the oldportress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:--"My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul hasentered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have noteven left the door."A man responded:--"But there is a light in that room, nevertheless."They recognized Javert's voice.The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the cornerof the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placedhimself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.The door opened.Javert entered.The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress wereaudible in the corridor.The nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element,the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This wasimpregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In hiseyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; hewas religious, superficial and correct on this point as on all others.In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was acreature who never sins; they were souls walled in from this world,with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to passthrough.On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled himimperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remainand to venture on at least one question.This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javertknew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence."Sister," said he, "are you alone in this room?"A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as thoughshe should faint.The sister raised her eyes and answered:--"Yes.""Then," resumed Javert, "you will excuse me if I persist; it is my duty;you have not seen a certain person--a man--this evening? He has escaped;we are in search of him--that Jean Valjean; you have not seen him?"The sister replied:--"No."She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, withouthesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself."Pardon me," said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoinedyour sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!The sister's affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he didnot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just beenextinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidlydeparting from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was JeanValjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or threecarters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressedin a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out.But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few daysbefore, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was theone.One last word about Fantine.We all have a mother,--the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.The cure thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, inreserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left forthe poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of thetown. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reducedit to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper's grave.So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongsto anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, Godknows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade,among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to thepromiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Hergrave resembled her bed.[THE END OF VOLUME I. "FANTINE"][Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Two  2frontispiece][Illustration: Titlepage Volume Two  2titlepage]VOLUME II.--COSETTEBOOK FIRST.--WATERLOOCHAPTER I--WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLESLast year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the personwho is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing hiscourse towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad pavedroad, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills whichsucceed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and producesomething in the nature of enormous waves.He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceivedthe slate-roofed tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which has the form of areversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; andat the angle of the cross-road, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbetbearing the inscription Ancient Barrier No. 4, a public house, bearingon its front this sign: At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau,Private Cafe.A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a littlevalley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made throughthe embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very greentrees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed overthe meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order inthe direction of Braine-l'Alleud.On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cartat the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of driedbrushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, anda ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A younggirl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably ofsome outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering inthe wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotillaof ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. Thewayfarer struck into this.After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenthcentury, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, hefound himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinearimpost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flatmedallions. A severe facade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicularto the facade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abruptright angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, throughwhich, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed.The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an oldrusty knocker.The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A bravelittle bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in alarge tree.The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the footof the pier of the door.At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant womanemerged.She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at."It was a French cannon-ball which made that," she said to him. And sheadded:--"That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is thehole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not piercethe wood.""What is the name of this place?" inquired the wayfarer."Hougomont," said the peasant woman.The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, andwent off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through thetrees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this elevationsomething which at that distance resembled a lion.He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.CHAPTER II--HOUGOMONTHougomont,--this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle,the first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, calledNapoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of hisaxe.It was a chateau; it is no longer anything but a farm. For theantiquary, Hougomont is Hugomons. This manor was built by Hugo, Sireof Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey ofVilliers.The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under theporch, and entered the courtyard.The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of thesixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything elsehaving fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has itsbirth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, ofthe time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, somecarts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chickenjumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a smallbell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against thewall of the chapel--behold the court, the conquest of which was one ofNapoleon's dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seizedit, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens arescattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is ahuge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.The English behaved admirably there. Cooke's four companies of guardsthere held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildingsand enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle ofwhich is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southerndoor, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun's length away.Hougomont has two doors,--the southern door, that of the chateau; andthe northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brotherJerome against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bacheluhurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille wasemployed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann's balls were exhaustedon this heroic section of wall. Bauduin's brigade was not strong enoughto force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not domore than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but withouttaking it.The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the northdoor, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists offour planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attackare visible.The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has hada piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, standshalf-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall,built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the courtyard onthe north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in all farms,with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the meadows.The dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long time, all sortsof imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was therethat Bauduin was killed.The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror isvisible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it livesand it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the deathagony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildingswhich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in,but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of thechateau, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises ina crumbling state,--disembowelled, one might say. The chateau servedfor a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated eachother. The French, fired on from every point,--from behind the walls,from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, throughall the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in thestones,--fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply to thegrape-shot was a conflagration.In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, thedismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; theEnglish guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of thestaircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appearslike the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; theEnglish, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, hadcut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone,which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps stillcling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. Theseinaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles ajaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there:one is dead; the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed withverdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken to growing through thestaircase.A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recoveredits calm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since thecarnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there--an altar ofunpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Fourwhitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;over the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a squareair-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner,an old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces--such is thechapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne,of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been carriedoff by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for amoment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled thisbuilding; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor wasburned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed upon hisfeet, of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen; then itstopped,--a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of theneighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than theChrist.The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ thisname is to be read: Henquinez. Then these others: Conde de Rio MaiorMarques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana). There are French names withexclamation points,--a sign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashedin 1849. The nations insulted each other there.It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up whichheld an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There aretwo in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulleyto this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water notdrawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume vanKylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there.On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves inthe woods.The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunatepeople who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. Thereare at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burnedtrees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in thedepths of the thickets.Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, "to guard the chateau," andconcealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there.They tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced thisfrightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats oftheir swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. Itwas from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught.This well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Deathhas a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to followglory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, andit was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast intoit. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says theywere not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeblevoices were heard calling from the well.This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, partstone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded likethe leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side isopen. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom hasa sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. Thislittle tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The ironsupports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over, theeye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-upmass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is concealedin a growth of nettles.This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms thetable for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by across-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knottyand petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer eitherpail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which servedthe overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time abird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then fliesaway. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. Thedoor of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside apretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placedslanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, graspedthis handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewedoff his hand with an axe.The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume vanKylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair saidto us: "I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older,was terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went therein my mother's arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitatedthe cannon, and went boum! boum!"A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, sowe were told. The orchard is terrible.It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The firstpart is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. Thesethree parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, thebuildings of the chateau and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on theright, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is ofbrick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first.It slopes downwards, is planted with gooseberry bushes, choked with awild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a monumental terrace of cutstone, with balustrade with a double curve.It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded LeNotre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted byglobes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters canstill be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.Almost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed onthe pediment like a fractured leg.It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that sixlight-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and beingunable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which wasarmed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and firedfrom above. The infantry men, replying from below, six against twohundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took aquarter of an hour to die.One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms,fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems readyto renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English atirregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth are placed twoEnglish tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in the south wall, asthe principal attack came from that quarter. The wall is hidden on theoutside by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had todeal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacleand an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eightloopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls, and Soye'sbrigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the Frenchscaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees.All this grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, sevenhundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, againstwhich Kellermann's two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has itsbuttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horsesbrowse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse thespaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; onewalks over this uncultivated land, and one's foot dives into mole-holes.In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which liesthere all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneatha great tree in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat,descended from a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edictof Nantes. An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over to one side,its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam. Nearly allthe apple-trees are falling with age. There is not one which has nothad its bullet or its biscayan.[6] The skeletons of dead trees abound inthis orchard. Crows fly through their branches, and at the end of it isa wood full of violets.Bauduin, killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, arivulet formed of English blood, French blood, German blood mingledin fury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and theregiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, theEnglish Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the fortyfrom Reille's corps, decimated, three thousand men in that hovel ofHougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with theirthroats cut,--and all this so that a peasant can say to-day to thetraveller: Monsieur, give me three francs, and if you like, I willexplain to you the affair of Waterloo!CHAPTER III--THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815Let us turn back,--that is one of the story-teller's rights,--and putourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier thanthe epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book tookplace.If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th ofJune, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few dropsof water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All thatProvidence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitzwas a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of seasonsufficed to make a world crumble.The battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleveno'clock, and that gave Blucher time to come up. Why? Because the groundwas wet. The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmerbefore they could manoeuvre.Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. Thefoundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report tothe Directory on Aboukir, said: Such a one of our balls killed six men.All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to hisvictory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated thestrategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach in it.He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolvedbattles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter in hisgenius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break lines, tocrush and disperse masses,--for him everything lay in this, tostrike, strike, strike incessantly,--and he intrusted this task to thecannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for thespace of fifteen years.On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,because he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred andfifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the actionwould have begun at six o'clock in the morning. The battle would havebeen won and ended at two o'clock, three hours before the change offortune in favor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches toNapoleon for the loss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated thisepoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war wornout the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word,was this genius, as many historians of note have thought, suffering froman eclipse? Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakenedpowers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the delusion ofa breath of adventure? Had he become--a grave matter in ageneral--unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class ofmaterial great men, who may be called the giants of action, when geniusgrows short-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal;for the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness;is it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleonlost the direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where hecould no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, nolonger discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost his power ofscenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known all theroads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning,pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached thatstate of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legionsharnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of forty-sixwith a supreme madness? Was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longeranything more than an immense dare-devil?We do not think so.His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. Togo straight to the centre of the Allies' line, to make a breach in theenemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal,and the Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments ofWellington and Blucher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels,to hurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. Allthis was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon. Afterwardspeople would see.Of course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle ofWaterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which weare relating is connected with this battle, but this history is not oursubject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in amasterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from anotherpoint of view by a whole pleiad of historians.[7]As for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distantwitness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil allmade of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; wehave no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of factswhich contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practicenor strategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chainof accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomesa question of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like thatingenious judge, the populace.CHAPTER IV--AThose persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloohave only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limbof the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe,the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l'Alleud. Thetop of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tipis Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jerome Bonaparte; the righttip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of thischord is the precise point where the final word of the battle waspronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, the involuntarysymbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and thetie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateauconstituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended tothe right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d'Erlonfacing Picton, Reille facing Hill.Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is theforest of Soignes.As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vastundulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and allthe undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in theforest.Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is aquestion of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to tripup the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support;an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lackof a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields itsground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, across-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, canstay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent itsretreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolvingon the responsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump oftrees, and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean,now called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington,with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat ofa great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June,Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English armywas stationed above, the French army below.It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon onhorseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, onJune 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him.That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school ofBrienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of theLegion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of redribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the whitehorse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the cornerscrowned N's and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs,the sword of Marengo,--that whole figure of the last of the Caesars ispresent to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severelyregarded by others.That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose froma certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and whichalways veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day historyand daylight have arrived.That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar anddivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because itis wholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people hadhitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two differentphantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, andthe shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader.Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations.Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Caesar,Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is amisfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.CHAPTER V--THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLESEvery one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginningwhich was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both armies, butstill more so for the English than for the French.It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, thewater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as ifin casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buriedup to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquidmud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transportson the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath thewheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction ofPapelotte would have been impossible.The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was inthe habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,aiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it hadbeen his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallopfreely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should comeout and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It wasno longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired,the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that itwas thirty-five minutes past eleven.The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than theEmperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting onHougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurlingQuiot's brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the rightwing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested onPapelotte.The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to drawWellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan wouldhave succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the braveBelgians of Perponcher's division had not held the position solidly, andWellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himselfto despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies ofguards and one battalion from Brunswick.The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels,to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean,to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thenceon Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a few incidents thisattack succeeded Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularlyin Kempt's brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers werevaliant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperienceextricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularlyexcellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhatto himself, becomes, so to speak, his own general. These recruitsdisplayed some of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of aninfantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.There is in this day an obscure interval, from mid-day to four o'clock;the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participatesin the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it.We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernaliaof war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches,cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red bootswith a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, thealmost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantryof England, the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on theslopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse withtheir oblong casques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails,the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaitersof our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic lines--what Salvator Rosarequires, not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. Quidobscurum, quid divinum. Each historian traces, to some extent, theparticular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever maybe the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has anincalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enterinto each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point ofthe field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just asmore or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water whichis poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers thanone would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. Theline of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of bloodgush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regimentsform capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs arecontinually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood theartillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, thebattalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It hasdisappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance andretreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? anoscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,not a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of thosepowerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is betterthan Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o'clock.Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is whatconfers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, thatthere is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,becomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats,which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, "belong rather tothe biography of the regiments than to the history of the army." Thehistorian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. Hecannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, andit is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be,to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called abattle.This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularlyapplicable to Waterloo.Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to apoint.CHAPTER VI--FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOONTowards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious. ThePrince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: "Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!"Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured fromthe French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed theEnglish general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battlehad, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Ofthe German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; allthe officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousandcombatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the EnglishGuards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by hiscompanions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baringhad been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost,one from Alten's division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg,carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays nolonger existed; Ponsonby's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces.That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneaththe cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, sixhundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on theearth,--Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled byseven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, thefifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but onerallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellingtonreinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; hesummoned Chasse, who was at Braine-l'Alleud.The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, andvery compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau ofMont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it theslope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stonedwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, andwhich marks the intersection of the roads--a pile of the sixteenthcentury, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it withoutinjuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges hereand there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat ofa cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery wasambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorizedby war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had beendespatched by the Emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitrethe enemy's batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returnedand reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the twobarricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It wasat the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau abattalion of Kempt's brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, wasconcealed in the tall wheat.Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was wellposted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds ofGroenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither withoutdissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there.The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat,according to many a man versed in the art,--though it is disputed byothers,--would have been a disorganized flight.To this centre, Wellington added one of Chasse's brigades taken from theright wing, and one of Wincke's brigades taken from the left wing, plusClinton's division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, tothe brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave asreinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau's contingent,Kielmansegg's Hanoverians, and Ompteda's Germans. This placed twenty-sixbattalions under his hand. The right wing, as Charras says, was thrownback on the centre. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth atthe spot where there now stands what is called the "Museum of Waterloo."Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, Somerset'sDragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining halfof the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somersetremained.The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, wasranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bagsof sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; therehad been no time to make a palisade for it.Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remainedthe whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old millof Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, whichan Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for twohundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly heroic.The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at hisside. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him: "Mylord, what are your orders in case you are killed?" "To do like me,"replied Wellington. To Clinton he said laconically, "To hold this spotto the last man." The day was evidently turning out ill. Wellingtonshouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca:"Boys, can retreat be thought of? Think of old England!"Towards four o'clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothingwas visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and thesharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged bythe shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, nowintersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; aretrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellingtondrew back. "The beginning of retreat!" cried Napoleon.CHAPTER VII--NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMORThe Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble,had never been in a better humor than on that day. His impenetrabilityhad been smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, thatprofound soul masked by marble beamed blindly. The man who had beengloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo. The greatest favorites ofdestiny make mistakes. Our joys are composed of shadow. The supremesmile is God's alone.Ridet Caesar, Pompeius flebit, said the legionaries of the FulminatrixLegion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it iscertain that Caesar laughed. While exploring on horseback at one o'clockon the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, thecommunes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of thelong line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon fromFrischemont to Braine-l'Alleud, it had seemed to him that fate, towhom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact tothe appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some timemotionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder;and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterioussaying, "We are in accord." Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longerin accord.He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was markedby a joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts,halting here and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, nearthe wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; hethought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.He said: "It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for thepurpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English whohave just arrived at Ostend." He conversed expansively; he regained theanimation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March, whenhe pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the GulfJuan, and cried, "Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!" Onthe night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. "Thatlittle Englishman needs a lesson," said Napoleon. The rain redoubled inviolence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.At half-past three o'clock in the morning, he lost one illusion;officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him thatthe enemy was not making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not abivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. Thesilence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens.At four o'clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; thispeasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probablyVivian's brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in thevillage of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o'clock, two Belgiandeserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,and that the English army was ready for battle. "So much the better!"exclaimed Napoleon. "I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drivethem back."In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms anangle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant'schair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with atruss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chartof the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, "A prettychecker-board."In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports ofprovisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive bymorning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. Thisdid not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, "We haveninety chances out of a hundred." At eight o'clock the Emperor'sbreakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. Duringbreakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nightsbefore, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond's; and Soult, a roughman of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, "The ball takes placeto-day." The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, "Wellington will not beso simple as to wait for Your Majesty." That was his way, however. "Hewas fond of jesting," says Fleury de Chaboulon. "A merry humor wasat the foundation of his character," says Gourgaud. "He abounded inpleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty," says BenjaminConstant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence. It washe who called his grenadiers "his grumblers"; he pinched their ears; hepulled their mustaches. "The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,"is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the islandof Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the Frenchbrig of war, Le Zephyr, having encountered the brig L'Inconstant, onwhich Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleonfrom L'Inconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white andamaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle ofElba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself,"The Emperor is well." A man who laughs like that is on familiar termswith events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during thebreakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of anhour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen inhand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to themthe order of battle.At nine o'clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelonsand set in motion in five columns, had deployed--the divisions in twolines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; asthey beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets,mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets onthe horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, "Magnificent!Magnificent!"Between nine o'clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as itmay appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines,forming, to repeat the Emperor's expression, "the figure of six V's."A few moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst ofthat profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a storm,which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, ashe beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his ordersfrom the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin theaction by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersectionof the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, "There are fourand twenty handsome maids, General."Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed beforehim, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointedto barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried.All this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughtypity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a largetomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massingthemselves, he said, "It is a pity."Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected forhis post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right ofthe road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station duringthe battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o'clock in theevening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable;it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which theguard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the ballsrebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As atBrienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of theheavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapelessprojectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where hishorse' feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of sixtypounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb,was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to hisguide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to thesaddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every discharge of canisterand tried to hide behind Napoleon: "Fool, it is shameful! You'll getyourself killed with a ball in the back." He who writes these lines hashimself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning overthe sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by theoxidization of six and forty years, and old fragments of iron whichparted like elder-twigs between the fingers.Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of theplains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place,are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from thismournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real reliefhas been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds herbearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifyingit. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later,exclaimed, "They have altered my field of battle!" Where the greatpyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was ahillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, butwhich was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height ofthe two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road fromGenappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other,the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The wholeof that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the thousands uponthousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred andfifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateauof Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day ofbattle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt anddifficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the Englishcannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley,which was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rainshad still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated theproblem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fastin the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whosepresence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l'Alleud is a Belgianvillage; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed incurves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and ahalf in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level,and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, whichmakes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the presentday, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean betweenthe two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a levelwith the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have beenappropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and still is,a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench,sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep,crumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under drivingrains. Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at theBraine-l'Alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as isproved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which givesthe name of the dead, Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels,and the date of the accident, February, 1637.[8] It was so deep onthe table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise,was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated onanother stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process ofclearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible onthe grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte andthe farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no wayindicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at thesummit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible;that is to say, terrible.CHAPTER VIII--THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTESo, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen,really admirable.The battle once begun, its very various changes,--the resistance ofHougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; thedisabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye's brigade wasshattered; Guilleminot's fatal heedlessness when he had neither petardnor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescortedpieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of thebombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves inthe rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud,so that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness of Pire'sdemonstration on Braine-l'Alleud; all that cavalry, fifteen squadrons,almost exterminated; the right wing of the English badly alarmed, theleft wing badly cut into; Ney's strange mistake in massing, instead ofechelonning the four divisions of the first corps; men delivered over togrape-shot, arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep and with a frontageof two hundred; the frightful holes made in these masses by thecannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenlyunmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and Durutte compromised;Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at thePolytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was beating in with anaxe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the Englishbarricade which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels;Marcognet's division caught between the infantry and the cavalry, shotdown at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack, putto the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of seven pieces spiked; the Princeof Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, in spite of the Comte d'Erlon, bothFrischemont and Smohain; the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the45th captured; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of theflying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavreand Plancenoit; the alarming things that had been said by prisoners;Grouchy's delay; fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomontin less than an hour; eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shortertime about La Haie-Sainte,--all these stormy incidents passing like theclouds of battle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze andhad not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty. Napoleon wasaccustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rendingdetails, cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided thatthey furnished the total, victory; he was not alarmed if the beginningsdid go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessorat the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of thequestion, and he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate,Thou wilt not dare.Composed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himselfprotected in good and tolerated in evil. He had, or thought that he had,a connivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in his favor,which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.Nevertheless, when one has Beresina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behindone, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A mysterious frownbecomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. He suddenlybeheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the van of theEnglish army disappear. It was rallying, but hiding itself. The Emperorhalf rose in his stirrups. The lightning of victory flashed from hiseyes.Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes anddestroyed--that was the definitive conquest of England by France; it wasCrecy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. The man of Marengowas wiping out Agincourt.So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept hisglass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. Hisguard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from belowwith a sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted thedeclivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, thepath; he seemed to be counting each bush. He gazed with some intentnessat the English barricades of the two highways,--two large abatis oftrees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with twocannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commandedthe extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelleswhere gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chasse's brigade. Near thisbarricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white,which stands at the angle of the cross-road near Braine-l'Alleud; hebent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide madea negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious.The Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.Wellington had drawn back.All that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him.Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed toParis to announce that the battle was won.Napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.He had just found his clap of thunder.He gave orders to Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the table-land ofMont-Saint-Jean.CHAPTER IX--THE UNEXPECTEDThere were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front aquarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses.There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them tosupport them Lefebvre-Desnouettes's division,--the one hundred and sixpicked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred andninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred andeighty lances. They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirassesof beaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and longsabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, atnine o'clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing "Let uswatch o'er the Safety of the Empire," they had come in a solid column,with one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, anddeployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont,and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line,so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on its extreme leftKellermann's cuirassiers and on its extreme right Milhaud's cuirassiers,had, so to speak, two wings of iron.Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor's orders. Ney drew hissword and placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were setin motion.Then a formidable spectacle was seen.All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung tothe breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneousmovement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ramwhich is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged intothe terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen, disappearedthere in the smoke, then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on theother side of the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting ata full trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them,the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. Theyascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals betweenthe musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible.Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier's divisionheld the right, Delort's division was on the left. It seemed as thoughtwo immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crestof the table-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy.Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt ofthe Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney wasagain present. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster andhad but one soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of apolyp. They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was renthere and there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormyheaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish oftrumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasseslike the scales on the hydra.These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel tothis vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which toldof the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with humanheads and equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible,invulnerable, sublime--gods and beasts.Odd numerical coincidence,--twenty-six battalions rode to meettwenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow ofthe masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares,two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the firstline, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders,taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm,mute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiersdid not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. Theyheard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate andsymmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of thecuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savagebreathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once,a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above thecrest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three thousand headswith gray mustaches, shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!" All this cavalrydebouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of anearthquake.All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, thehead of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. Onarriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterlygiven over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares andcannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,--a trenchbetween them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,directly under the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its doubleslopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushedon the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on theirhaunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelmingthe riders; and there being no means of retreat,--the whole column beingno longer anything more than a projectile,--the force which had beenacquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravinecould only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell,grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: whenthis trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them andpassed on. Almost a third of Dubois's brigade fell into that abyss.This began the loss of the battle.A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that twothousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow roadof Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses whichwere flung into this ravine the day after the combat.Let us note in passing that it was Dubois's sorely tried brigade which,an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flagof the Lunenburg battalion.Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud'scuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to seethat hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface ofthe plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the littlewhite chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelleshighway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of anobstacle, to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We mightalmost affirm that Napoleon's catastrophe originated in that sign of apeasant's head.Other fatalities were destined to arise.Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? We answer No.Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Blucher? No. Because of God.Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of thenineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in whichthere was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events haddeclared itself long before.It was time that this vast man should fall.The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance.This individual alone counted for more than a universal group. Theseplethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; the worldmounting to the brain of one man,--this would be mortal to civilizationwere it to last. The moment had arrived for the incorruptible andsupreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the principles and theelements, on which the regular gravitations of the moral, as of thematerial, world depend, had complained. Smoking blood, over-filledcemeteries, mothers in tears,--these are formidable pleaders. Whenthe earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there are mysteriousgroanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an ear.Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had beendecided on.He embarrassed God.Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of theUniverse.CHAPTER X--THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEANThe battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.Sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank onthe cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute tothe English battery.The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered thesquares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for ahalt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not discouragedthem. They belonged to that class of men who, when diminished in number,increase in courage.Wathier's column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort's column,which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment ofan ambush, had arrived whole.The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth pistols infist,--such was the attack.There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man untilthe soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns intogranite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not stir.Then it was terrible.All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenziedwhirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The firstrank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the secondranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers chargedtheir guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage ofan eruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers repliedby crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these fourliving wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared,ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the belliesof these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probablynever been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry,closed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter ofgrape-shot, they created explosions in their assailants' midst. The formof this combat was monstrous. These squares were no longer battalions,they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they werea tempest. Each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud; lava contendedwith lightning.The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in theair, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formedof the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centredropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of theforests and the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were beingexterminated around him, and seated on a drum, with his pibroch underhis arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died thinking of BenLothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier,which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end tothe song by killing the singer.The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminishedby the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English armyagainst them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of themwas equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded.Wellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon atthat same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle.This forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake.All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, foundthemselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Beforethem two squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundreddragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with theGerman light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers;the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in therear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides. What mattered itto them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something indescribable.In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was stillthundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could neverhave been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on theshoulder by a ball from a biscayan,[9] is in the collection of theWaterloo Museum.For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. Itwas no longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzytransport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In aninstant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred.Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up withthe lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes's light-horse. The plateauof Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. Thecuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to putit more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each otherwithout releasing the other. The squares still held firm.There were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Halfthe cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.The English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had theynot been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollowroad the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided thevictory. This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, who had seenTalavera and Badajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished, admiredheroically. He said in an undertone, "Sublime!"The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took orspiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English regimentssix flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard boreto the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.Wellington's situation had grown worse. This strange battle was like aduel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting andstill resisting, is expending all his blood.Which of the two will be the first to fall?The conflict on the plateau continued.What had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thingis certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and hishorse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles atMont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. Thishorseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up thebody still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was eighteenyears old at that time.Wellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand.The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not brokenthrough. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellingtonheld the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest andthe slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleedingof that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demandedreinforcements. "There are none," replied Wellington; "he must lethimself be killed!" Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidencewhich paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantryfrom Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, "Infantry! Where does he expectme to get it? Does he think I can make it?"Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. Thefurious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron andbreasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clusteredround a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalionwas commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten's division,already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed;the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze's brigade strewed the rye-fieldsall along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutchgrenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811,fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to theEnglish standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers wasconsiderable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the followingday, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussleof the cuirassiers, Delort, l'Heritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, andBlancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Altenwounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Omptedakilled, the whole of Wellington's staff decimated, and England had theworse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guardshad lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns;the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officerskilled, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of Cumberland, awhole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was destined to betried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the presence of thefray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat all the wayto Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, thewagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gainingground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch,mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, "Alarm!" From Vert-Coucou toGroentendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues in the directionof Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are stillalive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was suchthat it attacked the Prince de Conde at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. atGhent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind theambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian'sand Vandeleur's brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington hadno cavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts areattested by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so faras to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousandmen. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, theAustrian commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were presentat the battle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At fiveo'clock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur thesesinister words, "Blucher, or night!"It was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed onthe heights in the direction of Frischemont.Here comes the change of face in this giant drama.CHAPTER XI--A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BULOWThe painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for,Blucher arriving. Death instead of life.Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was SaintHelena that was seen.If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bulow, Blucher'slieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest aboveFrischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenthcentury might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won thebattle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit,the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable forartillery, and Bulow would not have arrived.Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour's delay, andBlucher would not have found Wellington on his feet. "The battle waslost."It was time that Bulow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover,been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had setout at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuckfast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover,he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre;the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, sothe caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows ofburning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration wasextinguished. It was mid-day before Bulow's vanguard had been able toreach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been overat four o'clock, and Blucher would have fallen on the battle won byNapoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite whichwe cannot comprehend.The Emperor had been the first, as early as mid-day, to descry with hisfield-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted hisattention. He had said, "I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to betroops." Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, "Soult, what do you see inthe direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?" The marshal, levelling hisglass, answered, "Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy."But it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staffhad studied "the cloud" pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: "It istrees." The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detachedDomon's division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.Bulow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and couldaccomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the armycorps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces beforeentering into line; but at five o'clock, perceiving Wellington's peril,Blucher ordered Bulow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: "Wemust give air to the English army."A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Rysseldeployed before Lobau's corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussiadebouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and thePrussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard inreserve behind Napoleon.CHAPTER XII--THE GUARDEvery one knows the rest,--the irruption of a third army; the battlebroken to pieces; eighty-six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously;Pirch the first coming up with Bulow; Zieten's cavalry led by Blucherin person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau ofOhain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating;Lobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on ourdismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming theoffensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the Frencharmy; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding eachother; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; theGuard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of allthings.Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, "Vive l'Empereur!"History records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth inacclamations.The sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that verymoment,--it was eight o'clock in the evening--the clouds on the horizonparted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun topass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen itrise at Austerlitz.Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this finalcatastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan,were there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, withtheir large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line,tranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect forFrance; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the fieldof battle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors,believing themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellingtonshouted, "Up, Guards, and aim straight!" The red regiment of Englishguards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shotriddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurledthemselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, theImperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vastshock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken theplace of the "Vive l'Empereur!" and, with flight behind it, it continuedto advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that it took.There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. The soldier inthat troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man was missingin that suicide.Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offeredhimself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killedunder him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, withuniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-strokefrom a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet;bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said,"Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!" Butin vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d'Erlon hehurled this question, "Are you not going to get yourself killed?" Inthe midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men,he shouted: "So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have allthese English bullets enter my bowels!" Unhappy man, thou wert reservedfor French bullets!CHAPTER XIII--THE CATASTROPHEThe rout behind the Guard was melancholy.The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,--Hougomont, LaHaie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry "Treachery!" was followed bya cry of "Save yourselves who can!" An army which is disbanding islike a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles,hastens, is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Neyborrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword,places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English andFrench. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, heinsults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers flyfrom him, shouting, "Long live Marshal Ney!" Two of Durutte's regimentsgo and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between theswords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best,Pack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat;friends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalionsbreak and disperse against each other, like the tremendous foam ofbattle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn intothe tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him ofhis Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceablesquadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur,Lobau before Bulow, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic beforePrince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor's squadrons to thecharge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallopspast the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreatsthem. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, "Long livethe Emperor!" remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The Prussiancavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes, kills,exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of theartillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make theirescape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog theroad and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walkover the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills theroads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys,the woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. Shoutsdespair, knapsacks and guns flung among the rye, passages forced atthe point of the sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no moregenerals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the sword atits leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battlefront, to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entranceto the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussiancanister, all took to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That volley ofgrape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brickbuilding on the right of the road at a few minutes' distance before youenter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, nodoubt, that they were not more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit wasstupendous. Blucher ordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubriousexample of threatening with death any French grenadier who should bringhim a Prussian prisoner. Blucher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the generalof the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe,surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slewthe prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination of thevanquished. Let us inflict punishment, since we are history: oldBlucher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing touch to thedisaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras,traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversedThuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeingin that manner? The Grand Army.This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiestbravery which ever astounded history,--is that causeless? No. The shadowof an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day ofdestiny. The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hencethe terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great soulssurrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallenprone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling thepresent shadow of a terrible presence. Hoc erat in fatis. That day theperspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is thehinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man wasnecessary to the advent of the great century. Some one, a person to whomone replies not, took the responsibility on himself. The panic of heroescan be explained. In the battle of Waterloo there is something more thana cloud, there is something of the meteor. God has passed by.At nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand seized bythe skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister,gloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had justdismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and withwild eye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immensesomnambulist of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more toadvance.CHAPTER XIV--THE LAST SQUARESeveral squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat,as rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came,death also; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowedthemselves to be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated from therest, and having no bond with the army, now shattered in every part,died alone. They had taken up position for this final action, some onthe heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There,abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares endured theirdeath-throes in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, diedwith them.At twilight, towards nine o'clock in the evening, one of them was leftat the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley,at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, nowinundated by the masses of the English, under the converging firesof the victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density ofprojectiles, this square fought on. It was commanded by an obscureofficer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished andreplied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continuallycontracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing breathless for amoment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy andever-decreasing thunder.When this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was leftof their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were nolonger anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than thegroup of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those mendying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English artillery,taking breath, became silent. This furnished a sort of respite. Thesecombatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm ofspectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon,the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossaldeath's-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in thedepths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at them. Through theshades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matchesall lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle roundtheir heads; all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached thecannons, and then, with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspendedabove these men, an English general, Colville according to some,Maitland according to others, shouted to them, "Surrender, braveFrenchmen!" Cambronne replied, "-----."{EDITOR'S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word "Merde!"in lieu of the ----- above.}CHAPTER XV--CAMBRONNEIf any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended, onewould have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhapsthe finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would enjoin us fromconsigning something sublime to History.At our own risk and peril, let us violate this injunction.Now, then, among those giants there was one Titan,--Cambronne.To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander? For beingwilling to die is the same as to die; and it was not this man's fault ifhe survived after he was shot.The winner of the battle of Waterloo was not Napoleon, who was put toflight; nor Wellington, giving way at four o'clock, in despair at five;nor Blucher, who took no part in the engagement. The winner of Waterloowas Cambronne.To thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills you isto conquer!Thus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give thispedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the midnightrainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the sunken road ofOhain, to Grouchy's delay, to Blucher's arrival, to be Irony itself inthe tomb, to act so as to stand upright though fallen, to drown intwo syllables the European coalition, to offer kings privies whichthe Caesars once knew, to make the lowest of words the most lofty byentwining with it the glory of France, insolently to end Waterloo withMardigras, to finish Leonidas with Rabellais, to set the crown on thisvictory by a word impossible to speak, to lose the field and preservehistory, to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage,--this isimmense!It was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches thegrandeur of AEschylus!Cambronne's reply produces the effect of a violent break. 'Tis like thebreaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. 'Tis the overflow of agonybursting forth. Who conquered? Wellington? No! Had it not been forBlucher, he was lost. Was it Blucher? No! If Wellington had not begun,Blucher could not have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending hislast hour, this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizesthat here is a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, and so doublyagonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because ofit, he is offered this mockery,--life! How could he restrain himself?Yonder are all the kings of Europe, the general's flushed with victory,the Jupiter's darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousandvictorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; theircannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind downunder their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they havejust crushed Napoleon, and only Cambronne remains,--only this earthwormis left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriateword as one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is theword. In face of this mean and mighty victory, in face of this victorywhich counts none victorious, this desperate soldier stands erect. Hegrants its overwhelming immensity, but he establishes its triviality;and he does more than spit upon it. Borne down by numbers, by superiorforce, by brute matter, he finds in his soul an expression: "Excrement!"We repeat it,--to use that word, to do thus, to invent such anexpression, is to be the conqueror!The spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descenton that unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rougetinvents the "Marseillaise," under the visitation of a breath from onhigh. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comessweeping over these men, and they shake, and one of them sings the songsupreme, and the other utters the frightful cry.This challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls not only at Europe inthe name of the Empire,--that would be a trifle: he hurls it at the pastin the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognizedas possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to bespeaking! Kleber seems to be bellowing!At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, "Fire!"The batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouthsbelched a last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume of smoke,vaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when thesmoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. That formidableremnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of theliving redoubt lay prone, and hardly was there discernible, here andthere, even a quiver in the bodies; it was thus that the French legions,greater than the Roman legions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soilwatered with rain and blood, amid the gloomy grain, on the spot wherenowadays Joseph, who drives the post-wagon from Nivelles, passeswhistling, and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o'clock in themorning.CHAPTER XVI--QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE?The battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who wonit as to those who lost it. For Napoleon it was a panic;[10] Bluchersees nothing in it but fire; Wellington understands nothing in regardto it. Look at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentariesinvolved. Some stammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle ofWaterloo into four moments; Muffling cuts it up into three changes;Charras alone, though we hold another judgment than his on some points,seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of thatcatastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All theother historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this dazzledstate they fumble about. It was a day of lightning brilliancy; in fact,a crumbling of the military monarchy which, to the vast stupefaction ofkings, drew all the kingdoms after it--the fall of force, the defeat ofwar.In this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by menamounts to nothing.If we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blucher, do we thereby depriveEngland and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious Englandnor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. ThankHeaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats ofthe sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained ina scabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords,above Blucher, Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England hasByron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and inthat aurora England and Germany have a magnificent radiance. Theyare majestic because they think. The elevation of level which theycontribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds fromthemselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they havebrought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It isonly barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That isthe temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized people,especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good orbad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human speciesresults from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank God! theirdignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers which thosegamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of battles.Often a battle is lost and progress is conquered. There is less gloryand more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the word. It isa game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloocoldly from both sides. Let us render to chance that which is dueto chance, and to God that which is due to God. What is Waterloo? Avictory? No. The winning number in the lottery.The quine [11] won by Europe, paid by France.It was not worth while to place a lion there.Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon andWellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God,who is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a moreextraordinary comparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry,prudence, an assured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinatecoolness, an imperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantageof the ground, tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions,carnage, executed according to rule, war regulated, watch in hand,nothing voluntarily left to chance, the ancient classic courage,absolute regularity; on the other, intuition, divination, militaryoddity, superhuman instinct, a flaming glance, an indescribablesomething which gazes like an eagle, and which strikes like thelightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity, all the mysteriesof a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream, the plain, theforest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to obey, the despotgoing even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle; faith ina star mingled with strategic science, elevating but perturbing it.Wellington was the Bareme of war; Napoleon was its Michael Angelo; andon this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. On both sidessome one was awaited. It was the exact calculator who succeeded.Napoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not come. Wellington expectedBlucher; he came.Wellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his dawning,had encountered him in Italy, and beaten him superbly. The old owl hadfled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not only struckas by lightning, but disgraced. Who was that Corsican of six and twenty?What signified that splendid ignoramus, who, with everything againsthim, nothing in his favor, without provisions, without ammunition,without cannon, without shoes, almost without an army, with a merehandful of men against masses, hurled himself on Europe combined,and absurdly won victories in the impossible? Whence had issued thatfulminating convict, who almost without taking breath, and with the sameset of combatants in hand, pulverized, one after the other, the fivearmies of the emperor of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmseron Beaulieu, Melas on Wurmser, Mack on Melas? Who was this novice inwar with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical military schoolexcommunicated him, and as it lost its footing; hence, the implacablerancor of the old Caesarism against the new; of the regular swordagainst the flaming sword; and of the exchequer against genius. On the18th of June, 1815, that rancor had the last word. and beneath Lodi,Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, it wrote: Waterloo. A triumph ofthe mediocres which is sweet to the majority. Destiny consented to thisirony. In his decline, Napoleon found Wurmser, the younger, again infront of him.In fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.Waterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second.That which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; theEnglish firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superbthing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was nother captain; it was her army.Wellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst,that his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a"detestable army." What does that sombre intermingling of bones buriedbeneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?England has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To makeWellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing buta hero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, thoseregiments of Maitland and of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack and Kempt,that cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing thepibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt,those utterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to handle a musketholding their own against Essling's and Rivoli's old troops,--that iswhat was grand. Wellington was tenacious; in that lay his merit, and weare not seeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and ofhis cavalry would have been as solid as he. The iron soldier is worthas much as the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to theEnglish soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophythere be, it is to England that the trophy is due. The column ofWaterloo would be more just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it boreon high the statue of a people.But this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. Shestill cherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion.She believes in heredity and hierarchy. This people, surpassed by nonein power and glory, regards itself as a nation, and not as a people. Andas a people, it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for itshead. As a workman, it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier, itallows itself to be flogged.It will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant whohad, it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan,as the English military hierarchy does not permit any hero below thegrade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports.That which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature ofWaterloo, is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, thewall of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon,Napoleon's guide deceiving him, Bulow's guide enlightening him,--thewhole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.On the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of abattle at Waterloo.Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest frontfor such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters of a league;Wellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side.From this denseness the carnage arose.The following calculation has been made, and the following proportionestablished: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent;Russians, thirty per cent; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram,French, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French,thirty-seven per cent; Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French,thirteen per cent; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo,French, fifty-six per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo,forty-one per cent; one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants;sixty thousand dead.To-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth,the impassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.At night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if atraveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreamslike Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of thecatastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June livesagain; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes inair, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulateover the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frighteneddreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare ofbombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were,the death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battlephantom; those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers;that skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this nolonger exists, and yet it clashes together and combats still; and theravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even inthe clouds and in the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont,Mont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedlycrowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.CHAPTER XVII--IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?There exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hateWaterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefieddate of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg iscertainly unexpected.If one places one's self at the culminating point of view of thequestion, Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. Itis Europe against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna againstParis; it is the statu quo against the initiative; it is the 14thof July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is themonarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable Frenchrioting. The final extinction of that vast people which had been ineruption for twenty-six years--such was the dream. The solidarity of theBrunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgswith the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It istrue, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the naturalreaction of things, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutionalorder was the unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of theconquerors. It is because revolution cannot be really conquered, andthat being providential and absolutely fatal, it is always croppingup afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones;after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the charter.Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and a sergeanton the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate equality;Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rightsof man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is, call itProgress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress,call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, and it isalready fulfilling it to-day. It always reaches its goal strangely. Itemploys Wellington to make of Foy, who was only a soldier, an orator.Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the tribune. Thus doesprogress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman.It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work theman who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalidof Father Elysee. It makes use of the gouty man as well as of theconqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within. Waterloo,by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, hadno other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued inanother direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of thethinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursuedits march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; thatwhich smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him all themarshals' staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of amarshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full ofbones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribedon that pedestal the date "June 18, 1815"; that which encouragedBlucher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, from theheights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as overits prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolutionwhich murmured that infamous word "dismemberment." On arriving in Paris,it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorchedits feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the stammer of acharter.Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of intentionalliberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal,in the same manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon wasinvoluntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mountedRobespierre was hurled from his saddle.CHAPTER XVIII--A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHTEnd of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world asit expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians;only the barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of thecounter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, andhalted short. The Empire was bewept,--let us acknowledge the fact,--andbewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into asceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over theearth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light. We will saymore; an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. Thisdisappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse.Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of Julyeffaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became theantithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries waswhite. The exile reigned. Hartwell's pine table took its place in frontof the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoywere mentioned as though they had taken place on the precedingday, Austerlitz having become antiquated. The altar and the thronefraternized majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the healthof society in the nineteenth century was established over France, andover the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon wascelebrated. The device non pluribus impar re-appeared on the stone raysrepresenting a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay.Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. TheArc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown outof its element among these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, ofMarengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its predicament with thestatue of the Duc d'Angouleme. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terriblepauper's grave in 1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since thebones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth,recalling the fact that the Duc d'Enghien had perished in the verymonth when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed thecoronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on thefall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there wasa little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King ofRome. And these things took place, and the kings resumed their thrones,and the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime becamethe new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the earthchanged place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer's day, ashepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, "Go this way, and not that!"This 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy andpoisonous realities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; fictions becameconstitutional; prejudices, superstitions and mental reservations, withArticle 14 in the heart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was theserpent's change of skin.Man had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under thisreign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name ofideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the futureinto derision. The populace, however, that food for cannon which is sofond of the cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What ishe doing? "Napoleon is dead," said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengoand Waterloo. "He dead!" cried the soldier; "you don't know him."Imagination distrusted this man, even when overthrown. The depths ofEurope were full of darkness after Waterloo. Something enormous remainedlong empty through Napoleon's disappearance.The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited byit to undertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; Belle-Alliance,Beautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.In presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, thefeatures of a new France were sketched out. The future, which theEmperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star,Liberty. The glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it.Singular fact! people were, at one and the same time, in love withthe future, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered thevanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than Napoleonerect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded byHudson Lowe, and France had him watched by Montchenu. His folded armsbecame a source of uneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him "mysleeplessness." This terror was the result of the quantity ofrevolution which was contained in him. That is what explains and excusesBonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused the old world to tremble.The kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the rock of Saint Helenaon the horizon.While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, thesixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietlyrotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world.The Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called thisthe Restoration.This is what Waterloo was.But what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud,that war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for amoment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping fromone blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry tobelfry on the towers of Notre Dame.CHAPTER XIX--THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHTLet us return--it is a necessity in this book--to that fatalbattle-field.On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blucher'sferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, deliveredup that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided themassacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes duringcatastrophes.After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jeanremained deserted.The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual signof victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established theirbivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreatingrout, pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to drawup his report to Lord Bathurst.If ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable, it certainly is to thatvillage of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a league fromthe scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont wasburned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned,Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the twoconquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked notin the battle, bears off all the honor.We are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasionpresents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beautieswhich we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideousfeatures. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of thebodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battlealways rises on naked corpses.Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand isthat which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpocketsare they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Somephilosophers--Voltaire among the number--affirm that it is preciselythose persons have made the glory. It is the same men, they say; thereis no relief corps; those who are erect pillage those who are proneon the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night. One hasassuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one is theauthor of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so; it seemsto us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin theshoes from a dead man.One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors followthieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporarysoldier, out of the question.Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed.Bat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts ofvespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers ofuniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids;formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts,sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which theysell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers'servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,--we are notspeaking of the present,--dragged all this behind them, so that in thespecial language they are called "stragglers." No army, no nation,was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed theGermans, then spoke French and followed the English. It was by one ofthese wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquisof Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and taking him for oneof our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-fielditself, in the course of the night which followed the victory ofCerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim,Live on the enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict disciplinealone could heal. There are reputations which are deceptive; one doesnot always know why certain generals, great in other directions, havebeen so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he toleratedpillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was sogood that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire andblood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less innumber, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche andMarceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justiceto mention it.Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the deadwere robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught inthe act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole inone corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.The moon was sinister over this plain.Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in thedirection of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one ofthose whom we have just described,--neither English nor French, neitherpeasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scentof the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifleWaterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat;he was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him.Who was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. Hehad no sack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat. Fromtime to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though tosee whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed somethingsilent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His slidingmotion, his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused himto resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins, and which ancientNorman legends call the Alleurs.Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among themarshes.A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceivedat some distance a sort of little sutler's wagon with a fluted wickerhood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass acrossits bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoinsthe highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jeanto Braine l'Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffersand packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon andthat prowler.The darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it ifthe earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences ofthe sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but notfallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night.A breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers whichresembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.In the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general roundsof the English camp were audible.Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in thewest, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by thecordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubieswith two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immensesemicircle over the hills along the horizon.We have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart isterrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so manybrave men.If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpassesdreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full possessionof virile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh valiantly; to rushtowards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; to feel inone's breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will whichreasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife,to have children; to have the light--and all at once, in the space of ashout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to fall, toroll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers, leaves,branches; not to be able to catch hold of anything; to feel one's sworduseless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain,since one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feela heel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses'shoes in one's rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, andto say to one's self, "But just a little while ago I was a living man!"There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle,all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered withhorses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! Therewas no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with theplain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. Aheap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lowerpart--such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. Theblood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a largepool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spotwhich is still pointed out.It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in thedirection of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiershad taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportionedto the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the pointwhere it became level, where Delort's division had passed, the layer ofcorpses was thinner.The nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was goingin that direction. He was searching that vast tomb. He gazed about. Hepassed the dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feetin the blood.All at once he paused.A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point wherethe pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon,projected from beneath that heap of men. That hand had on its fingersomething sparkling, which was a ring of gold.The man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, andwhen he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.He did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightenedattitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizonon his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on histwo forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering abovethe edge of the hollow road. The jackal's four paws suit some actions.Then coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.At that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch himfrom behind.He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had seizedthe skirt of his coat.An honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh."Come," said he, "it's only a dead body. I prefer a spook to agendarme."But the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted inthe grave."Well now," said the prowler, "is that dead fellow alive? Let's see."He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything thatwas in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulledout the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, orat least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. Hewas a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of considerable rank;a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officerno longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut had scarred his face,where nothing was discernible but blood.However, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happychance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaultedabove him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. Hiseyes were still closed.On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the gulfswhich he had beneath his great coat.Then he felt of the officer's fob, discovered a watch there, and tookpossession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse andpocketed it.When he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administeringto this dying man, the officer opened his eyes."Thanks," he said feebly.The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, thefreshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had rousedhim from his lethargy.The prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps wasaudible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.The officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:--"Who won the battle?""The English," answered the prowler.The officer went on:--"Look in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them."It was already done.The prowler executed the required feint, and said:--"There is nothing there.""I have been robbed," said the officer; "I am sorry for that. You shouldhave had them."The steps of the patrol became more and more distinct."Some one is coming," said the prowler, with the movement of a man whois taking his departure.The officer raised his arm feebly, and detained him."You have saved my life. Who are you?"The prowler answered rapidly, and in a low voice:--"Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If theywere to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now getout of the scrape yourself.""What is your rank?""Sergeant.""What is your name?""Thenardier.""I shall not forget that name," said the officer; "and do you remembermine. My name is Pontmercy."BOOK SECOND.--THE SHIP ORIONCHAPTER I--NUMBER 24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430Jean Valjean had been recaptured.The reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the saddetails. We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphspublished by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprisingevents which had taken place at M. sur M.These articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at thatepoch the Gazette des Tribunaux was not yet in existence.We borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc. It bears the date of July25, 1823.An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of anevent quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in theDepartment, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to thenew methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, themanufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his fortunein the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit.He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The policediscovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who hadbroken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previousto his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M.Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, andwhich he had, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired inhis business. No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean hasconcealed this money since his return to prison at Toulon.The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is anextract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date.A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has justappeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstancescalculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escapingthe vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeededin getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns;in this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at lastbeen unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of thepublic prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, whodied of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who isendowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three orfour days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more,in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of thoselittle vehicles which run between the capital and the village ofMontfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by thisinterval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerablesum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has beenestimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment isto be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone,and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be,the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of theDepartment of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied withviolence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honestchildren who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,          ". . . Arrive from Savoy every year,           And who, with gentle hands, do clear           Those long canals choked up with soot."This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful andeloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft wascommitted in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a memberof a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guiltyand was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminalrefused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, hasdeigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. JeanValjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits atM. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, presented thiscommutation as a triumph of the priestly party.Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not beobliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanishedwith M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of feverand hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was a soullacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotisticaldivision of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismembermentof flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, inthe human community, and which history has noted only once, because itoccurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings;superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Enviousrivalries arose. M. Madeleine's vast workshops were shut; his buildingsfell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted thecountry, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was doneon a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead ofthe general good. There was no longer a centre; everywhere therewas competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all anddirected all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things tohimself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization,bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence ofthe founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set weretangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products weredebased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack oforders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, bankruptcyarrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere.Less than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizesestablishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for thebenefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in thearrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villele called attention to thefact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.CHAPTER II--IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THEDEVIL'S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLYBefore proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in somedetail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch,in Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certainconjectures of the indictment.There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,which is all the more curious and all the more precious, becausea popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe inSiberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in thenature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected theforest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it isno rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest,a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing woodenshoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by thefact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on hishead. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man ishabitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profitingby such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him.Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears blackbecause it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, butis cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for hornsis nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whoseteeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from hishead. The man returns home and dies within the week. The second way isto watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled itand has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, toopen it once more and to seize the "treasure" which the black manhas necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within the month.Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to lookat him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. One then dieswithin the year.As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, thesecond, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others thatof possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generallyadopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quitefrequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the blackman, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appearsto be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and inparticular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which anevil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left onthis subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges deBocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarilyextremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night--for it must be doneat night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock,and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand onthe "treasure," what does he find? What is the devil's treasure? A sou,sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimesa spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio,sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon's verses seem to announce to theindiscreet and curious:--          "Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,           As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque."It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn withbullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which hasevidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds,since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does notappear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon's time,and cards before the time of Charles VI.Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that onepossesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the propertyof making your gun burst in your face.Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecutingattorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight ofseveral days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked inthat village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had"peculiar ways" in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew thatthis Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected tocertain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, theadministration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on thecross-road from Gagny to Lagny.This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by theinhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt inremoving his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presenceof the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, they said;suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The onlything in his favor was that he was a drunkard.This is what people thought they had noticed:--Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breakingand care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself tothe forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening inthe most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had theappearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was diggingholes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; thenthey recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassuredthereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a livelydispleasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there wassome mystery in what he was doing.It was said in the village: "It is clear that the devil has appeared.Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunningenough to pocket Lucifer's hoard."The Voltairians added, "Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will thedevil catch Boulatruelle?" The old women made a great many signs of thecross.In the meantime, Boulatruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased; and heresumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped ofsomething else.Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all thisthere was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but somefine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil'sbank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. Themost "puzzled" were the school-master and Thenardier, the proprietor ofthe tavern, who was everybody's friend, and had not disdained to allyhimself with Boulatruelle."He has been in the galleys," said Thenardier. "Eh! Good God! no oneknows who has been there or will be there."One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law wouldhave instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest,and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he wouldhave been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruellewould not have resisted the water test, for example. "Let us put him tothe wine test," said Thenardier.They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combinedwith admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of agormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint ofreturning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the fewobscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thenardierand the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:--One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak,he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush,a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say.However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel andpick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought nomore about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without beingseen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, "a person who did notbelong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well," directinghis steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation byThenardier: A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refusedto reveal his name. This person carried a package--something square,like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle.However, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes thatthe idea of following that "person" had occurred to him. But it was toolate; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, andBoulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him. Then he hadadopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods. "It wasmoonlight." Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this personemerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shoveland pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had notdreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other manwas three times as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and thathe would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and onperceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comradeson meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of lightto Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and hadfound neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference thatthis person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buriedthe coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer wastoo small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence hisresearches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entireforest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to himto have been recently turned up. In vain.He had "ferreted out" nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any moreabout it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, "You may becertain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that troublefor nothing; he was sure that the devil had come."CHAPTER III--THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORYMANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMERTowards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants ofToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and forthe purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship Orion, which wasemployed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a partof the Mediterranean squadron.This vessel, battered as it was,--for the sea had handled itroughly,--produced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew somecolors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns, whichit returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two. It has been calculatedthat what with salvos, royal and military politenesses, courteousexchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities of roadsteads andcitadels, sunrises and sunsets, saluted every day by all fortresses andall ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc., the civilizedworld, discharged all over the earth, in the course of four and twentyhours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots. At six francs theshot, that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day, three hundredmillions a year, which vanish in smoke. This is a mere detail. All thistime the poor were dying of hunger.The year 1823 was what the Restoration called "the epoch of the Spanishwar."This war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities.A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of Francesuccoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say,performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to ournational traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to thecabinets of the North; M. le Duc d'Angouleme, surnamed by the liberalsheets the hero of Andujar, compressing in a triumphal attitude thatwas somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and verypowerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimericalterrorism of the liberals; the sansculottes resuscitated, to the greatterror of dowagers, under the name of descamisados; monarchy opposing anobstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of '89 roughlyinterrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French idea,which was making the tour of the world; beside the son of France asgeneralissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles Albert,enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as avolunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of theEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eightyears of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standardwaved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard hadbeen thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our troops;the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets;principles slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by her arms thatwhich she had done by her mind; in addition to this, hostile leaderssold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by millions; no militaryperils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which is surprisedand invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame for some,glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended fromLouis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Itssad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics.Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadero, amongothers, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, thetrumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect wassuspicious; history approves of France for making a difficulty aboutaccepting this false triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanishofficers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea ofcorruption was connected with the victory; it appears as though generalsand not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier returnedhumiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the Bank of France couldbe read in the folds of the flag.Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidableruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began toregret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchinerather than Ballesteros in front of her.From a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also properto insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spiritof France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise ofinthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, theson of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideouscontradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not tostifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the FrenchRevolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact. Blindis he who will not see! It was Bonaparte who said it.The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then,at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was Francewho committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with theexception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foulmeans. The words passive obedience indicate this. An army is a strangemasterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sumof impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despitehumanity, explained.As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it fora success. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an ideaslain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degreethat they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into theirestablishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambushentered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanishcampaign became in their counsels an argument for force and foradventures by right Divine. France, having re-established elrey nettoin Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king at home. Theyfell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier forthe consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones. It isnot permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of a machineel tree,nor in the shadow of an army.Let us return to the ship Orion.During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo,a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just statedthat the Orion belonged to this fleet, and that accidents of the sea hadbrought it into port at Toulon.The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it whichattracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowdloves what is great.A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of thegenius of man with the powers of nature.A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest andthe lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same timewith three forms of substance,--solid, liquid, and fluid,--and it mustdo battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which toseize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and moreantennae than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Itsbreath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as throughenormous trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeksto lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but thevessel has its soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows itthe north. In the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place ofthe stars. Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas;against the water, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead;against the shadows, its light; against immensity, a needle.If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which,taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to enterone of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brestor Toulon. The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glassthere, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great column ofwood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach isthe main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in theclouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its base isthree feet. The English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred andseventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers employedcables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains on a ship of ahundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth, and eightfeet in depth. And how much wood is required to make this ship? Threethousand cubic metres. It is a floating forest.And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here ofthe military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel;steam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that prodigywhich is called a war vessel. At the present time, for example, themixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine, propelled by threethousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand fivehundred horse-power.Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of ChristopherColumbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is asinexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores upthe wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of thebillows, it floats, and it reigns.There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-footyard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall,when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the jawsof the waves like a fisherman's hook in the jaws of a pike, when thosemonstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which the hurricanebears forth into the void and into night, when all that power and allthat majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior.Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immensefeebleness it affords men food for thought, Hence in the ports curiouspeople abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation,without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day,accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and thejetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlersand loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staringat the Orion.The Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the courseof its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on itskeel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had goneinto the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the barnaclesscraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning hadaffected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the BalearicIsles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the platingin those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak.A violent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved ina grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged theforetop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the Orion hadrun back to Toulon.It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs werebegun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of theplanks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to permitof air entering the hold.One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.[Illustration: The Ship Orion, An Accident 2b2-1-the-ship-orion]The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take theupper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance;he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered acry; the man's head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the yard,with his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he seized thefootrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and remained hangingfrom it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fallhad imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayedback and forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not oneof the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for theservice, dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topmanwas losing his strength; his anguish could not be discerned on his face,but his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were contractedin horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend servedbut to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, forfear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute when heshould release his hold on the rope, and, from instant to instant, headswere turned aside that his fall might not be seen. There are momentswhen a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, andit is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it andfall like a ripe fruit.All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agilityof a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he wore agreen cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the top, agust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head tobe seen: he was not a young man.A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, infact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had askedthe officer's permission to risk his life to save the topman; at anaffirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to hisankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and haddashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what easethat chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident wasrecalled.In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds andappeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during whichthe breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemedcenturies to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised hiseyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He wasseen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastenedthe rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end to hangdown, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,--andthe anguish was indescribable,--instead of one man suspended over thegulf, there were two.One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here thespider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened onthis group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted everybrow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add theslightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to aposition near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and theexhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall intothe abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to whichhe clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last, hewas seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him;he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength, then hegrasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard himself tothe cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him in the handsof his comrades.At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeantsamong them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and allvoices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, "Pardon for thatman!"He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoinhis detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he droppedinto the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes werefollowing him. At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it wasthat he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw himhesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout: theconvict had fallen into the sea.The fall was perilous. The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside theOrion, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it wasto be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four menflung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on;anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen tothe surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, asthough he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived. Invain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even findthe body.On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:--"Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment onboard of the Orion, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor,fell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been found; itis supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point:this man was committed under the number 9,430, and his name was JeanValjean."BOOK THIRD.--ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMANCHAPTER I--THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEILMontfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edgeof that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. Atthe present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the yearthrough with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor somany well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Somepleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to besure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies intwisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sortsof varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; butMontfermeil was none the less a village. Retired cloth-merchants andrusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peacefuland charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there peoplelived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous andso easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of theplateau.It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end ofthe village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent pondswhich exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds thechurch and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-wateronly at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road toChelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. Thelarge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thenardier tavern formed apart, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business ofit, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplyingMontfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until seveno'clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night oncecome and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had nowater to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader hasprobably not forgotten,--little Cosette. It will be remembered thatCosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways: they made the motherpay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceasedto pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in precedingchapters, the Thenardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servantin their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water whenit was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea ofgoing to the spring at night, took great care that water should never belacking in the house.Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snownor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtainedpermission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street ofthe village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of thesame tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader willperhaps remember, the Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. These peoplefilled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquillittle district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part ofa faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiositiesdisplayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightfulclowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited tothe peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilianvultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and whichhave a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists callthis bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides,and to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers,who had retired to the village, went to see this creature with greatdevotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was aunique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, wereseated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles inthe public room of Thenardier's hostelry. This room resembled alldrinking-shop rooms,--tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers;but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionablein the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin.The female Thenardier was attending to the supper, which was roasting infront of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his customers andtalking politics.Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjectsthe Spanish war and M. le Duc d'Angouleme, strictly local parentheses,like the following, were audible amid the uproar:--"About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. Whenten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded agreat deal of juice under the press." "But the grapes cannot be ripe?""In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily assoon as spring comes." "Then it is very thin wine?" "There are winespoorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green." Etc.Or a miller would call out:--"Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantityof small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to sendthrough the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed,fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, whichabound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I am not fond ofgrinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams withnails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. Andthen people complain of the flour. They are in the wrong. The flour isno fault of ours."In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with alanded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to beperformed in the spring, was saying:--"It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a goodthing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is youngand very hard to cut still. It's terribly tender. It yields before theiron." Etc.Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchentable near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust intowooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollenstockings destined for the young Thenardiers. A very young kitten wasplaying about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible inthe adjoining room, from two fresh children's voices: it was Eponine andAzelma.In the chimney-corner a cat-o'-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in thehouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boywho had been born to the Thenardiers during one of the precedingwinters,--"she did not know why," she said, "the result of thecold,"--and who was a little more than three years old. The mother hadnursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of thebrat became too annoying, "Your son is squalling," Thenardier wouldsay; "do go and see what he wants." "Bah!" the mother would reply, "hebothers me." And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.CHAPTER II--TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITSSo far in this book the Thenardiers have been viewed only in profile;the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, andconsidering it under all its aspects.Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier wasapproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; sothat there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thenardierwoman, ever since her first appearance,--tall, blond, red, fat, angular,square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to therace of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs withpaving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about thehouse,--made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everythingelse. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of anelephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,--window panes,furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches,presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an idealmarket-porter dressed in woman's clothes. She swore splendidly; sheboasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Exceptfor the romances which she had read, and which made the affected ladypeep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea wouldnever have occurred to any one to say of her, "That is a woman."This Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on afishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, "That is a gendarme"; whenone saw her drink, one said, "That is a carter"; when one saw her handleCosette, one said, "That is the hangman." One of her teeth projectedwhen her face was in repose.Thenardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who hada sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here;he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite toeverybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He hadthe glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatlyresembled the portraits of the Abbe Delille. His coquetry consisted indrinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering himdrunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse anold black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to materialism.There were certain names which he often pronounced to support whateverthings he might be saying,--Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularlyenough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had "a system." Inaddition, he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], ascientific thief. The species does exist. It will be remembered that hepretended to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relatingwith exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th lightsomething or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of asquadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and savedfrom death, in the midst of the grape-shot, "a general, who had beendangerously wounded." Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, andfor his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of "the cabaretof the Sergeant of Waterloo." He was a liberal, a classic, and aBonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in thevillage that he had studied for the priesthood.We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. Thisrascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming fromLille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, beingcomfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo,the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived thathe exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, wasthe leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentarylife, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardierbelonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken,beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, andtravelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a ricketycart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for alwaysattaching himself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, andhaving, as he said, "some quibus," he had come to Montfermeil and set upan inn there.This quibus, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silvercrosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, didnot amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turnedeating-house-keeper very far.Thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestureswhich, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a signof the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to bethought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster hadnoticed that he pronounced improperly.[12]He composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, butpractised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it.Thenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not disdainhis servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantesswas jealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man mustbe an object coveted by all.Thenardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was ascamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy entersinto it.It is not that Thenardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath toquite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at suchtimes, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he borewithin him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of thosepeople who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everythingthat passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and whoare always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as alegitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies,and the calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred upin him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe tothe person who came under his wrath at such a time!In addition to his other qualities, Thenardier was attentive andpenetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and alwayshighly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who areaccustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.Thenardier was a statesman.Every new-comer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of MadameThenardier, "There is the master of the house." A mistake. She was noteven the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked;he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constantmagnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; themastodon obeyed. Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being inMadame Thenardier's eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it.She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had adisagreement as to any detail with "Monsieur Thenardier,"--which wasan inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,--she would not have blamedher husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never havecommitted "before strangers" that mistake so often committed by women,and which is called in parliamentary language, "exposing the crown."Although their concord had only evil as its result, there wascontemplation in Madame Thenardier's submission to her husband. Thatmountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of thatfrail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side, this was thatgrand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certainugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty. Therewas an unknown quantity about Thenardier; hence the absolute empireof the man over that woman. At certain moments she beheld him like alighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except herchildren, and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was amother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short withher daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The man hadbut one thought,--how to enrich himself.He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent waslacking. Thenardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin ispossible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scampwould have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse wherefate has hitched him.It will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed in arestricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.In this same year, 1823, Thenardier was burdened with about fifteenhundred francs' worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,Thenardier was one of those men who understand best, with the mostprofundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtueamong barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilizedpeoples,--hospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quotedfor his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh,which was particularly dangerous.His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife's mind."The duty of the inn-keeper," he said to her one day, violently, and ina low voice, "is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire,dirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to emptysmall purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter travellingfamilies respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pickthe child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, thechimney-corner, the arm-chair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, thefeather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how muchthe shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by fivehundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, evenfor the flies which his dog eats!"This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded--a hideous andterrible team.While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thenardier thought notof absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, andlived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to theirdouble pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being ground upin a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the woman eachhad a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with blows--this was thewoman's; she went barefooted in winter--that was the man's doing.Cosette ran up stairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was,did the coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress andvenomous master. The Thenardier hostelry was like a spider's web, inwhich Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The idealof oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was somethinglike the fly serving the spiders.The poor child passively held her peace.What takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted God,find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in themidst of men all naked!CHAPTER III--MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATERFour new travellers had arrived.Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight yearsold, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with thelugubrious air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of ablow from Madame Thenardier's fist, which caused the latter to remarkfrom time to time, "How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!"Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers andcaraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must havebeen filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thenardierestablishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there;but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than tothe pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all thoseglasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But therecame a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thenardier raised thecover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glassand briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the childhad raised her head and was following all the woman's movements. A thinstream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass."Well," said she, "there is no more water!" A momentary silence ensued.The child did not breathe."Bah!" resumed Madame Thenardier, examining the half-filled glass, "thiswill be enough."Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of anhour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it werethe next morning.From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, andexclaimed, "It's as black as an oven!" or, "One must needs be a catto go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!" And Cosettetrembled.All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, andsaid in a harsh voice:--"My horse has not been watered.""Yes, it has," said Madame Thenardier."I tell you that it has not," retorted the pedler.Cosette had emerged from under the table."Oh, yes, sir!" said she, "the horse has had a drink; he drank out of abucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and Ispoke to him."It was not true; Cosette lied."There's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,"exclaimed the pedler. "I tell you that he has not been watered, youlittle jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which Iknow well."Cosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish,and which was hardly audible:--"And he drank heartily.""Come," said the pedler, in a rage, "this won't do at all, let my horsebe watered, and let that be the end of it!"Cosette crept under the table again."In truth, that is fair!" said Madame Thenardier, "if the beast has notbeen watered, it must be."Then glancing about her:--"Well, now! Where's that other beast?"She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of thetable, almost under the drinkers' feet."Are you coming?" shrieked Madame Thenardier.Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself.The Thenardier resumed:--"Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.""But, Madame," said Cosette, feebly, "there is no water."The Thenardier threw the street door wide open:--"Well, go and get some, then!"Cosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood nearthe chimney-corner.This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set downin it at her ease.The Thenardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in thestewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:--"There's plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious creatureas that. I think I should have done better to strain my onions."Then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, andshallots."See here, Mam'selle Toad," she added, "on your way back, you will get abig loaf from the baker. Here's a fifteen-sou piece."Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coinwithout saying a word, and put it in that pocket.Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her. Sheseemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue."Get along with you!" screamed the Thenardier.Cosette went out. The door closed behind her.CHAPTER IV--ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLLThe line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as thereader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. Thesebooths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass ontheir way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thenardiers'observed, produced "a magical effect." In compensation, not a star wasvisible in the sky.The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite theThenardiers' door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass,and magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, themerchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll,nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with goldwheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All thatday, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-byunder ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeilsufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child.Eponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and Cosetteherself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy andovercome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes tothat wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. The poor childpaused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to. Thewhole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was avision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared ina sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundlyengulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacityof childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her fromthat doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at least aprincess, to have a "thing" like that. She gazed at that beautiful pinkdress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, "How happy that dollmust be!" She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. Themore she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She thought she was gazingat paradise. There were other dolls behind the large one, which seemedto her to be fairies and genii. The merchant, who was pacing back andforth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of beingthe Eternal Father.In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which shewas charged.All at once the Thenardier's coarse voice recalled her to reality:"What, you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I'll give it to you! Iwant to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!"The Thenardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sightof Cosette in her ecstasy.Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of whichshe was capable.CHAPTER V--THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONEAs the Thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which isnear the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction ofChelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So longas she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, thelighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from thelast stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. Sheplunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made asmuch motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walkedalong. This made a noise which afforded her company.The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no onein the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned aroundon seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: "Where canthat child be going? Is it a werewolf child?" Then the woman recognizedCosette. "Well," said she, "it's the Lark!"In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and desertedstreets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side ofChelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on bothsides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From timeto time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of ashutter--this was light and life; there were people there, and itreassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackenedmechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the lasthouse, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the laststall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. Sheset her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, andbegan slowly to scratch her head,--a gesture peculiar to children whenterrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; itwas the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She gazed indespair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where therewere beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a goodlook, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly sawspectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear hadlent her audacity. "Bah!" said she; "I will tell him that there was nomore water!" And she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratchher head again. Now it was the Thenardier who appeared to her, with herhideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast amelancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do? Whatwas to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was thespectre of the Thenardier; behind her all the phantoms of the nightand of the forest. It was before the Thenardier that she recoiled. Sheresumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged fromthe village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at orlistening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breathfailed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went straightbefore her in desperation.As she ran she felt like crying.The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night wasfacing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, anatom.It was only seven or eight minutes' walk from the edge of the woods tothe spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many timesin daylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinctguided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or toleft, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. Inthis manner she reached the spring.It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayeysoil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.'s frills, and paved withseveral large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil littlenoise.Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was inthe habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in thedark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usuallyserved to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bentdown, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of suchviolent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over,she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself intothe spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neithersaw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set iton the grass.That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She wouldhave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill thebucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step. Shewas forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouchingthere.She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, butbecause she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucketbeside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were likemasses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely overthe child.Jupiter was setting in the depths.The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which shewas unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact, verynear the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which impartedto it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified thestar. One would have called it a luminous wound.A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leafwas moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender andmisshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulatedlike eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long armsfurnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather, tossedby the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in terrorbefore something which was coming after. On all sides there werelugubrious stretches.The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries himselfin the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye seesblack, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sootyopacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walksalone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and trees--twoformidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinctdepths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you witha spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in space or in one'sown brain, one knows not what vague and intangible thing, like thedreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon.One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid toglance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night,things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances,obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubriousreflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, unknownbut possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches, alarming torsos oftrees, long handfuls of quivering plants,--against all this one has noprotection. There is no hardihood which does not shudder and which doesnot feel the vicinity of anguish. One is conscious of something hideous,as though one's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness. Thispenetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of achild.Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soulproduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she wasseized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terroralone which was gaining possession of her; it was something moreterrible even than terror; she shivered. There are no words to expressthe strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom ofher heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should notbe able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,four, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular statewhich she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she hadfinished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception ofthe things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water,felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable terror, hadreturned: she had but one thought now,--to flee at full speed throughthe forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to thelighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood before her;such was the fright which the Thenardier inspired in her, that she darednot flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with bothhands; she could hardly lift the pail.In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; itwas heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She tookbreath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, andresumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again shewas obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again.She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; theweight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The ironhandle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;she was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did so,the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. Thistook place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from allhuman sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that sad thingat the moment.And her mother, no doubt, alas!For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves.She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat,but she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thenardier, even at adistance: it was her custom to imagine the Thenardier always present.However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she wenton very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, andof walking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguishthat it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil inthis manner, and that the Thenardier would beat her. This anguish wasmingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she wasworn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. Onarriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, madea last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get wellrested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucketagain, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperatecreature could not refrain from crying, "O my God! my God!"At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longerweighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had justseized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. Alarge black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through thedarkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose approachshe had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized thehandle of the bucket which she was carrying.There are instincts for all the encounters of life.The child was not afraid.CHAPTER VI--WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE'S INTELLIGENCEOn the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walkedfor rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard del'Hopital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seekinglodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modesthouses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber inthat isolated quarter.This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of whatmay be called the well-bred mendicant,--extreme wretchedness combinedwith extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspiresintelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the manwho is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a veryold and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectlythreadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the leasteccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerablecut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted;and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced apreceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He wouldhave been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectlywhite hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance,where everything breathed depression and weariness of life. Judging fromhis firm tread, from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements,he would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow werewell placed, and would have disposed in his favor any one who observedhim attentively. His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemedsevere, and which was humble. There was in the depth of his glance anindescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he carried a littlebundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of acudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, andhad an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of itsknots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it wasa cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in thewinter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but thiswithout any affectation.At that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi:it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two o'clock, almostinvariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at fullspeed along the Boulevard de l'Hopital.This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarterwho said, "It is two o'clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries."And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing kingalways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It wasrapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop;as he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladlyhave had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,in the midst of naked swords. His massive coach, all covered withgilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thunderednoisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In therear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of whitesatin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseauroyal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, twogreat epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, theGolden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion ofHonor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wideblue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat deckedwith white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high Englishgaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and salutedrarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind.When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of aninhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, "That big fellow yonder isthe government."This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, thedaily event of the Boulevard de l'Hopital.The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in thequarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as tothis detail. When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by asquadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouchedon the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpetriere, heappeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself inthis cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of anenclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spyinghim out.M. le Duc de Havre, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was seatedin the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty, "Yonderis an evil-looking man." Members of the police, who were clearing theking's route, took equal note of him: one of them received an order tofollow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of thefaubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace ofhim, as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comted'Angles, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track,he redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assurehimself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that isto say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatreof the Porte Saint-Martin, where The Two Convicts was being played thatday. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant laterhe was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the Platd'Etain [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagnywas then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses wereharnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were hastilyclimbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.The man inquired:--"Have you a place?""Only one--beside me on the box," said the coachman."I will take it.""Climb up."Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at thetraveller's shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and madehim pay his fare."Are you going as far as Lagny?" demanded the coachman."Yes," said the man.The traveller paid to Lagny.They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman triedto enter into conversation, but the traveller only replied inmonosyllables. The coachman took to whistling and swearing at hishorses.The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The mandid not appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay andNeuilly-sur-Marne.Towards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachmandrew up in front of the carters' inn installed in the ancient buildingsof the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell."I get down here," said the man.He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.An instant later he had disappeared.He did not enter the inn.When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did notencounter him in the principal street of Chelles.The coachman turned to the inside travellers."There," said he, "is a man who does not belong here, for I do not knowhim. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money;he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is night; allthe houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to befound. So he has dived through the earth."The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with greatstrides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then hehad turned to the right before reaching the church, into the cross-roadleading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with thecountry and had been there before.He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected bythe ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heardpeople coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and therewaited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution wasnearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a verydark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible inthe sky.It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did notreturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to theright, and entered the forest with long strides.Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a carefulexamination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seekingand following a mysterious road known to himself alone. There came amoment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused in indecision. Atlast he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, at a clearingwhere there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly tothese stones, and examined them attentively through the mists of night,as though he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered withthose excrescences which are the warts of vegetation, stood a few pacesdistant from the pile of stones. He went up to this tree and passedhis hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking to recognize andcount all the warts.Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had beennailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched thisband of zinc.Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the spacebetween the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying toassure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through theforest.It was the man who had just met Cosette.As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he hadespied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden onthe ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, andperceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucketof water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handleof the bucket.CHAPTER VII--COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARKCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almostbass."My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you."Cosette raised her head and replied:--"Yes, sir.""Give it to me," said the man; "I will carry it for you."Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her."It really is very heavy," he muttered between his teeth. Then headded:--"How old are you, little one?""Eight, sir.""And have you come from far like this?""From the spring in the forest.""Are you going far?""A good quarter of an hour's walk from here."The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:--"So you have no mother.""I don't know," answered the child.Before the man had time to speak again, she added:--"I don't think so. Other people have mothers. I have none."And after a silence she went on:--"I think that I never had any."The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placedboth hands on the child's shoulders, making an effort to look at her andto see her face in the dark.Cosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid lightin the sky."What is your name?" said the man."Cosette."The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her oncemore; then he removed his hands from Cosette's shoulders, seized thebucket, and set out again.After a moment he inquired:--"Where do you live, little one?""At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.""That is where we are going?""Yes, sir."He paused; then began again:--"Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?""It was Madame Thenardier."The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, butin which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:--"What does your Madame Thenardier do?""She is my mistress," said the child. "She keeps the inn.""The inn?" said the man. "Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. Showme the way.""We are on the way there," said the child.The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty.She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyestowards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribableconfidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray;nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope andjoy, and which mounted towards heaven.Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:--"Is there no servant in Madame Thenardier's house?""No, sir.""Are you alone there?""Yes, sir."Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:--"That is to say, there are two little girls.""What little girls?""Ponine and Zelma."This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to thefemale Thenardier."Who are Ponine and Zelma?""They are Madame Thenardier's young ladies; her daughters, as you wouldsay.""And what do those girls do?""Oh!" said the child, "they have beautiful dolls; things with gold inthem, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.""All day long?""Yes, sir.""And you?""I? I work.""All day long?"The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was notvisible because of the darkness, and replied gently:--"Yes, sir."After an interval of silence she went on:--"Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amusemyself, too.""How do you amuse yourself?""In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not manyplaythings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. Ihave only a little lead sword, no longer than that."The child held up her tiny finger."And it will not cut?""Yes, sir," said the child; "it cuts salad and the heads of flies."They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through thestreets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of thebread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply herwith questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving allthe open-air booths, asked Cosette:--"So there is a fair going on here?""No, sir; it is Christmas."As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:--"Monsieur?""What, my child?""We are quite near the house.""Well?""Will you let me take my bucket now?""Why?""If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me."The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the taverndoor.CHAPTER VIII--THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE'S HOUSE A POORMAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MANCosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the bigdoll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant's; then she knocked.The door opened. The Thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand."Ah! so it's you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you've taken yourtime! The hussy has been amusing herself!""Madame," said Cosette, trembling all over, "here's a gentleman whowants a lodging."The Thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace,a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought thenew-comer with her eyes."This is the gentleman?" said she."Yes, Madame," replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.Wealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspectionof the stranger's costume and baggage, which the Thenardier passed inreview with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and thegruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:--"Enter, my good man."The "good man" entered. The Thenardier cast a second glance at him, paidparticular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare,and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her head,wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted her husband,who was still drinking with the carters. The husband replied by thatimperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up by aninflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar.Thereupon, the Thenardier exclaimed:--"Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.""Put me where you like," said the man; "in the attic, in the stable. Iwill pay as though I occupied a room.""Forty sous.""Forty sous; agreed.""Very well, then!""Forty sous!" said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thenardier woman;"why, the charge is only twenty sous!""It is forty in his case," retorted the Thenardier, in the same tone. "Idon't lodge poor folks for less.""That's true," added her husband, gently; "it ruins a house to have suchpeople in it."In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place abottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket ofwater took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under thekitchen table, and her knitting.The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he hadpoured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. Wehave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette wasthin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to behardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost putout with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitualanguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.Her hands were, as her mother had divined, "ruined with chilblains." Thefire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all theangles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent.As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing herknees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag whichwould have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter.All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skinwas visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could bedescried, which marked the places where the Thenardier woman had touchedher. Her naked legs were thin and red. The hollows in her neck wereenough to make one weep. This child's whole person, her mien, herattitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed toelapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, herslightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,--fear.Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak;fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under herpetticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her onlythe breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what might becalled the habit of her body, admitting of no possible variation exceptan increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nookwhere terror lurked.Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did notdare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to herwork again.The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habituallyso gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments asthough she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had neverset foot in a church. "Have I the time?" said the Thenardier.The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.All at once, the Thenardier exclaimed:--"By the way, where's that bread?"Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thenardier uplifted hervoice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to theexpedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied."Madame, the baker's shop was shut.""You should have knocked.""I did knock, Madame.""Well?""He did not open the door.""I'll find out to-morrow whether that is true," said the Thenardier;"and if you are telling me a lie, I'll lead you a pretty dance. In themeantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece."Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green.The fifteen-sou piece was not there."Ah, come now," said Madame Thenardier, "did you hear me?"Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. Whatcould have become of that money? The unhappy little creature could notfind a word to say. She was petrified."Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?" screamed the Thenardier,hoarsely, "or do you want to rob me of it?"At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards thecat-o'-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength toshriek:--"Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!"The Thenardier took down the whip.In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fobof his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. Besides,the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not payingattention to anything.Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angleof the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nudelimbs. The Thenardier raised her arm."Pardon me, Madame," said the man, "but just now I caught sight ofsomething which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket, androlled aside. Perhaps this is it."At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floorfor a moment."Exactly; here it is," he went on, straightening himself up.And he held out a silver coin to the Thenardier."Yes, that's it," said she.It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thenardier foundit to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confinedherself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with theremark, "Don't let this ever happen again!"Cosette returned to what the Thenardier called "her kennel," and herlarge eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on anexpression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only aninnocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled withit."By the way, would you like some supper?" the Thenardier inquired of thetraveller.He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought."What sort of a man is that?" she muttered between her teeth. "He's somefrightfully poor wretch. He hasn't a sou to pay for a supper. Will heeven pay me for his lodging? It's very lucky, all the same, that it didnot occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor."In the meantime, a door had opened, and Eponine and Azelma entered.They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasantin looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses,the other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They werewarmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of thestuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was ahint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Lightemanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on thethrone. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which theymade, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thenardier said tothem in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, "Ah! there youare, you children!"Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing theirhair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them withthat gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, sheexclaimed, "What frights they are!"They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyouschatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting,and watched their play with a melancholy air.Eponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dogto them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twentyyears between them, but they already represented the whole society ofman; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.The doll of the Thenardier sisters was very much faded, very old, andmuch broken; but it seemed none the less admirable to Cosette, who hadnever had a doll in her life, a real doll, to make use of the expressionwhich all children will understand.All at once, the Thenardier, who had been going back and forth in theroom, perceived that Cosette's mind was distracted, and that, instead ofworking, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play."Ah! I've caught you at it!" she cried. "So that's the way you work!I'll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will."The stranger turned to the Thenardier, without quitting his chair."Bah, Madame," he said, with an almost timid air, "let her play!"Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton andhad drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had notthe air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to anorder. But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such adesire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have awill, was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate.She retorted with acrimony:--"She must work, since she eats. I don't feed her to do nothing.""What is she making?" went on the stranger, in a gentle voice whichcontrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter'sshoulders.The Thenardier deigned to reply:--"Stockings, if you please. Stockings for my little girls, who have none,so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now."The man looked at Cosette's poor little red feet, and continued:--"When will she have finished this pair of stockings?""She has at least three or four good days' work on them still, the lazycreature!""And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finishedthem?"The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him."Thirty sous at least.""Will you sell them for five francs?" went on the man."Good heavens!" exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh;"five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!"Thenardier thought it time to strike in."Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pairof stockings for five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers.""You must pay on the spot," said the Thenardier, in her curt andperemptory fashion."I will buy that pair of stockings," replied the man, "and," he added,drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table,"I will pay for them."Then he turned to Cosette."Now I own your work; play, my child."The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that heabandoned his glass and hastened up."But it's true!" he cried, examining it. "A real hind wheel! and notcounterfeit!"Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.The Thenardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, and her faceassumed an expression of hatred.In the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:--"Is it true, Madame? May I play?""Play!" said the Thenardier, in a terrible voice."Thanks, Madame," said Cosette.And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier, her whole little soulthanked the traveller.Thenardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:--"Who can this yellow man be?""I have seen millionaires with coats like that," replied Thenardier, ina sovereign manner.Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosettealways moved as little as possible. She picked up some old rags and herlittle lead sword from a box behind her.Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had justexecuted a very important operation; they had just got hold of thecat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Eponine, who wasthe elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and itscontortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. Whileperforming this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sisterin that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like thesplendor of the butterfly's wing, vanishes when one essays to fix itfast."You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,she cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall bemy little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shalllook at her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that willsurprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see hertail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, 'Ah! Mon Dieu!' andI will say to you: 'Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls aremade like that just at present.'"Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine.In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, andto laugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thenardier accompanied andencouraged them.As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out ofanything which comes to hand. While Eponine and Azelma were bundling upthe cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, shelaid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, oneof the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, toclothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold alittle, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that somethingis some one,--therein lies the whole woman's future. While dreaming andchattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing littlegowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, theyoung girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first childis the continuation of the last doll.A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite asimpossible, as a woman without children.So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man; "My husband is right," shethought; "perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!"She came and set her elbows on the table."Monsieur," said she. At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; up to thattime, the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme."You see, sir," she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even morerepulsive to behold than her fierce mien, "I am willing that the childshould play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because youare generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.""Then this child is not yours?" demanded the man."Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken inthrough charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on thebrain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, forwe are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and havereceived no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead.""Ah!" said the man, and fell into his revery once more."Her mother didn't amount to much," added the Thenardier; "she abandonedher child."During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by someinstinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from theThenardier's face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here andthere.Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeatingtheir unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced andwanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.The Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette,from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflectedfrom her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which shehad made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, "My mother isdead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!"On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, "the millionaire,"consented at last to take supper."What does Monsieur wish?""Bread and cheese," said the man."Decidedly, he is a beggar" thought Madame Thenardier.The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under thetable was singing hers.All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sightof the little Thenardiers' doll, which they had abandoned for the catand had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, andcast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thenardier was whispering toher husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playingwith the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing; nota glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose; she crept outfrom under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that noone was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seizedit. An instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, andonly turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in herarms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that itcontained all the violence of voluptuousness.No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring hismeagre supper.This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceivethat one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearthlighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot, projecting fromthe shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Eponine,"Look! sister."The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to taketheir doll!Eponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, andbegan to tug at her skirt."Let me alone!" said her mother; "what do you want?""Mother," said the child, "look there!"And she pointed to Cosette.Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or heardanything.Madame Thenardier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression whichis composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and whichhas caused this style of woman to be named megaeras.On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands onthe doll belonging to "these young ladies." A czarina who should seea muzhik trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear no otherface.She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:--"Cosette!"Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she turnedround."Cosette!" repeated the Thenardier.Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort ofveneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes fromit, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a childof that age, she wrung them; then--not one of the emotions of the day,neither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water,nor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sadwords which she had heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wringthis from her--she wept; she burst out sobbing.Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet."What is the matter?" he said to the Thenardier."Don't you see?" said the Thenardier, pointing to the corpus delictiwhich lay at Cosette's feet."Well, what of it?" resumed the man."That beggar," replied the Thenardier, "has permitted herself to touchthe children's doll!""All this noise for that!" said the man; "well, what if she did playwith that doll?""She touched it with her dirty hands!" pursued the Thenardier, "with herfrightful hands!"Here Cosette redoubled her sobs."Will you stop your noise?" screamed the Thenardier.The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.As soon as he had gone, the Thenardier profited by his absence to giveCosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loudcries.The door opened again, the man re-appeared; he carried in both hands thefabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village bratshad been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright infront of Cosette, saying:--"Here; this is for you."It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he hadspent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of thattoy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that it wasvisible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop.Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with thatdoll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedentedwords, "It is for you"; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; thenshe slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under thetable in a corner of the wall.She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of nolonger daring to breathe.The Thenardier, Eponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the verydrinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.Madame Thenardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures: "Whois that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? Perhaps he isboth; that is to say, a thief."The face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive fold whichaccentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appearsthere in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared alternately atthe doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, ashe would have scented out a bag of money. This did not last longer thanthe space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said toher in a low voice:--"That machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. Down on yourbelly before that man!"Gross natures have this in common with naive natures, that they possessno transition state."Well, Cosette," said the Thenardier, in a voice that strove to besweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women,"aren't you going to take your doll?"Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole."The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette," saidThenardier, with a caressing air. "Take it; it is yours."Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face wasstill flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky atdaybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt at that moment wasa little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told,"Little one, you are the Queen of France."It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dartfrom it.This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that theThenardier would scold and beat her.Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing nearand murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thenardier:--"May I, Madame?"No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, andecstatic."Pardi!" cried the Thenardier, "it is yours. The gentleman has given itto you.""Truly, sir?" said Cosette. "Is it true? Is the 'lady' mine?"The stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared to havereached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lesthe should weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the "lady's" hand inher tiny hand.Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the "lady" scorchedher, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add that at thatmoment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. All at once she wheeledround and seized the doll in a transport."I shall call her Catherine," she said.It was an odd moment when Cosette's rags met and clasped the ribbons andfresh pink muslins of the doll."Madame," she resumed, "may I put her on a chair?""Yes, my child," replied the Thenardier.It was now the turn of Eponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floorin front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, in anattitude of contemplation."Play, Cosette," said the stranger."Oh! I am playing," returned the child.This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit whichProvidence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thenardierhated worse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it wasnecessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulationthrough endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, theseemotions were more than she could endure. She made haste to send herdaughters to bed, then she asked the man's permission to send Cosetteoff also; "for she has worked hard all day," she added with a maternalair. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.From time to time the Thenardier went to the other end of the room whereher husband was, to relieve her soul, as she said. She exchanged withher husband words which were all the more furious because she dared notutter them aloud."Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in thismanner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-francdolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A littlemore and he will be saying Your Majesty to her, as though to the Duchessde Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that mysterious oldfellow?""Why! it is perfectly simple," replied Thenardier, "if that amuses him!It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have herplay. He's all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he paysfor it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? Ifhe is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for,so long as he has money?"The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither ofwhich admitted of any reply.The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtfulattitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, hadwithdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at himfrom a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressedman, who drew "hind-wheels" from his pocket with so much ease, andwho lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, wascertainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger stillremained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time hechanged the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not saida word since Cosette had left the room.The Thenardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained inthe room."Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?" grumbled theThenardier. When two o'clock in the morning struck, she declared herselfvanquished, and said to her husband, "I'm going to bed. Do as you like."Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle,and began to read the Courrier Francais.A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the CourrierFrancais at least three times, from the date of the number to theprinter's name. The stranger did not stir.Thenardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked hischair. Not a movement on the man's part. "Is he asleep?" thoughtThenardier. The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.At last Thenardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, andventured to say:--"Is not Monsieur going to his repose?"Not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. Torepose smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the mysteriousand admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day. Achamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous; a chamber in which onereposes costs twenty francs."Well!" said the stranger, "you are right. Where is your stable?""Sir!" exclaimed Thenardier, with a smile, "I will conduct you, sir."He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, andThenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was ofrare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtainedwith red calico."What is this?" said the traveller."It is really our bridal chamber," said the tavern-keeper. "My wife andI occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.""I should have liked the stable quite as well," said the man, abruptly.Thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on thechimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's head-dress insilver wire and orange flowers."And what is this?" resumed the stranger."That, sir," said Thenardier, "is my wife's wedding bonnet."The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,"There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?"Thenardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building forthe purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamberdecorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture andobtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that thiswould cast a graceful shadow on "his spouse," and would result in whatthe English call respectability for his house.When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thenardierhad withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night,as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom heproposed to fleece royally the following morning.The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was notasleep. When she heard her husband's step she turned over and said tohim:--"Do you know, I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow."Thenardier replied coldly:--"How you do go on!"They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candlewas extinguished.As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in acorner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an arm-chair andremained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes,took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, andquitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search ofsomething. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There heheard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. Hefollowed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built underthe staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess wasnothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of allsorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders' webs, was abed--if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holesas to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show thepallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.In this bed Cosette was sleeping.The man approached and gazed down upon her.Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the wintershe did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh asthough she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almostconvulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of herwooden shoes.A door which stood open near Cosette's pallet permitted a view of arather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the furtherextremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.They belonged to Eponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden,stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who hadcried all the evening lay asleep.The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of theThenardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fellupon the fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys where there isalways so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which areso cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not evenashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze,nevertheless. It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shapeand unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorialcustom in accordance with which children place their shoes in thechimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparklinggift from their good fairy. Eponine and Azelma had taken care not toomit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.The traveller bent over them.The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, andin each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sightof another object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, afrightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and allcovered with ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette's sabot. Cosette, withthat touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet neverdiscouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet andtouching thing.There was nothing in this wooden shoe.The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis d'orin Cosette's shoe.Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.CHAPTER IX--THENARDIER AND HIS MANOEUVRESOn the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,Thenardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, penin hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was followinghim with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there wasprofound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with whichone watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind. Anoise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,Thenardier produced the following masterpiece:--          BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.  Supper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     3 francs.  Chamber  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    10   "  Candle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     5   "  Fire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     4   "  Service  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     1   "                                          ----------                     Total . . . . . .    23 francs.Service was written servisse."Twenty-three francs!" cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which wasmingled with some hesitation.Like all great artists, Thenardier was dissatisfied."Peuh!" he exclaimed.It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France's bill at the Congressof Vienna."Monsieur Thenardier, you are right; he certainly owes that," murmuredthe wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in thepresence of her daughters. "It is just, but it is too much. He will notpay it."Thenardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:--"He will pay."This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. Thatwhich was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did notinsist.She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A momentlater he added:--"I owe full fifteen hundred francs!"He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with hisfeet among the warm ashes."Ah! by the way," resumed his wife, "you don't forget that I'm going toturn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart withthat doll of hers! I'd rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her anotherday in the house!"Thenardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:--"You will hand that bill to the man."Then he went out.Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.Thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless inthe half-open door, visible only to his wife.The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand."Up so early?" said Madame Thenardier; "is Monsieur leaving us already?"As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with anembarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hardface presented a shade which was not habitual with it,--timidity andscruples.To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air "of a poorwretch" seemed difficult to her.The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. Hereplied:--"Yes, Madame, I am going.""So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?""No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame," headded.The Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill.The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts wereevidently elsewhere."Madame," he resumed, "is business good here in Montfermeil?""So so, Monsieur," replied the Thenardier, stupefied at not witnessinganother sort of explosion.She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:--"Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois inthe neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, nowand then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we shouldnot get along at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child iscosting us our very eyes.""What child?""Why, the little one, you know! Cosette--the Lark, as she is calledhereabouts!""Ah!" said the man.She went on:--"How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more theair of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and wecannot bestow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal.The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths!Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money.And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring up other people'schildren."The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent,and in which there lingered a tremor:--"What if one were to rid you of her?""Who? Cosette?""Yes."The landlady's red and violent face brightened up hideously."Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry heraway, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and theblessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise beupon you!""Agreed.""Really! You will take her away?""I will take her away.""Immediately?""Immediately. Call the child.""Cosette!" screamed the Thenardier."In the meantime," pursued the man, "I will pay you what I owe you. Howmuch is it?"He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start ofsurprise:--"Twenty-three francs!"He looked at the landlady, and repeated:--"Twenty-three francs?"There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accentbetween an exclamation and an interrogation point.The Thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. Shereplied, with assurance:--"Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs."The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table."Go and get the child," said he.At that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room, andsaid:--"Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.""Twenty-six sous!" exclaimed his wife."Twenty sous for the chamber," resumed Thenardier, coldly, "and six sousfor his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a littlewith the gentleman. Leave us, wife."Madame Thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpectedlightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor wasmaking his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and leftthe room.As soon as they were alone, Thenardier offered the traveller a chair.The traveller seated himself; Thenardier remained standing, and his faceassumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity."Sir," said he, "what I have to say to you is this, that I adore thatchild."The stranger gazed intently at him."What child?"Thenardier continued:--"How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take backyour hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.""Whom do you mean?" demanded the stranger."Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away fromus? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will notconsent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was atiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she hasher faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paidout over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses!But one must do something for the good God's sake. She has neitherfather nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough forher and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child. Youunderstand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good sortof a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife isquick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same asour own child. I want to keep her to babble about the house."The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thenardier. The lattercontinued:--"Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one's child to a passer-by,like that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don't say--you are rich; youhave the air of a very good man,--if it were for her happiness. But onemust find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let her goand to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; Ishould not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whomshe is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so thatshe may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watchingover her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do noteven know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: 'Well,and the Lark, what has become of her?' One must, at least, see somepetty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!"The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, asthe saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in agrave, firm voice:--"Monsieur Thenardier, one does not require a passport to travel fiveleagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, andthat is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will notknow my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention isthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I breakthe thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you?Yes or no?"Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God bycertain signs, Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a verystrong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with hisclear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters,smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he haddevoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching himlike a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him,both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and throughinstinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for sodoing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in theyellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had soclearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thenardier had divined hispurpose. He had caught the old man's deep glances returning constantlyto the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideouscostume, when he had so much money in his purse? Questions which he putto himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him. Hehad pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette's father. Was heher grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When one hasa right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over Cosette.What was it, then? Thenardier lost himself in conjectures. He caughtglimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may, onentering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secretin the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in theshadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger'sclear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was mysterious inso simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He had expectednothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He ralliedhis ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thenardierwas one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decidedthat the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quicklyat that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which theyknow that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries."Sir," said he, "I am in need of fifteen hundred francs."The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of blackleather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on thetable. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to theinn-keeper:--"Go and fetch Cosette."While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found thegold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly newtwenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the littlePrussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Herdestiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was;she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as thoughshe had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessedwhence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full offear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent andbeautiful things did not appear real. The doll frightened her, thegold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of thismagnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary,he reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all heramazement, even in her sleep, she had been thinking in her littlechildish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad, and whowas so rich and so kind. Everything had changed for her since she hadmet that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the mostinsignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was to takerefuge under a mother's shadow and under a wing. For the last fiveyears, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child hadshivered and trembled. She had always been exposed completely nakedto the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed.Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was nolonger afraid of the Thenardier. She was no longer alone; there was someone there.She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which shehad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece hadfallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touchit, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hangingout, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused,remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of theentire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing atthe bottom of her pocket.It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thenardierjoined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband's orders.What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said aninsulting word to her."Cosette," she said, almost gently, "come immediately."An instant later Cosette entered the public room.The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it. Thisbundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian bodice, akerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes--a complete outfit for agirl of seven years. All was black."My child," said the man, "take these, and go and dress yourselfquickly."Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil whohad begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading alittle girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.It was our man and Cosette.No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did notrecognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know.Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leavingthe Thenardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding herfarewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She wasleaving that hated and hating house.Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazingat the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. Fromtime to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at thegood man. She felt something as though she were beside the good God.CHAPTER X--HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSEMadame Thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as washer wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette hadtaken their departure, Thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hourto elapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundredfrancs."Is that all?" said she.It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she haddared to criticise one of the master's acts.The blow told."You are right, in sooth," said he; "I am a fool. Give me my hat."He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ranout in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. Hefollowed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to himselfthe while:--"That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, thenfifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have givenfifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him."And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; allthat was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does notlet mysteries out of one's hand when one has once grasped them. Thesecrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to subjectthem to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain. "I am ananimal," said he.When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takesthat runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a greatdistance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that heought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far ashis vision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he hadwasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whomhe was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny.He hastened in that direction.They were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he walkedfast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like aman who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retracehis steps."I ought to have taken my gun," said he to himself.Thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass throughour midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear withoutour finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one side ofthem. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged. In acalm and even situation, Thenardier possessed all that is required tomake--we will not say to be--what people have agreed to call an honesttrader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances beinggiven, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface,he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper inwhom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionallycrouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thenardier dwelt, andhave fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece.After a momentary hesitation:--"Bah!" he thought; "they will have time to make their escape."And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with almostan air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey ofpartridges.In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an obliquedirection the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue deBellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit ofthe hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey ofChelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat onwhich he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man's hat.The brushwood was not high. Thenardier recognized the fact that the manand Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on accountof her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.Thenardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and lettingCosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwoodand presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was insearch of."Pardon, excuse me, sir," he said, quite breathless, "but here are yourfifteen hundred francs."So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.The man raised his eyes."What is the meaning of this?"Thenardier replied respectfully:--"It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette."Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thenardier's eyes the while,and enunciating every syllable distinctly:--"You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?""Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact,I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see;this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was hermother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. Youwill say to me, 'But her mother is dead.' Good; in that case I can onlygive the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed byher mother, to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the persontherein mentioned; that is clear."The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and Thenardierbeheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.The tavern-keeper shivered with joy."Good!" thought he; "let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!"Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:the spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in thewoods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more anddrew from it, not the handful of bills which Thenardier expected, but asimple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to theinn-keeper, saying:--"You are right; read!"Thenardier took the paper and read:--                              "M. SUR M., March 25, 1823. "MONSIEUR THENARDIER:--               You will deliver Cosette to this person.               You will be paid for all the little things.               I have the honor to salute you with respect,                                                  FANTINE.""You know that signature?" resumed the man.It certainly was Fantine's signature; Thenardier recognized it.There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, thevexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and thevexation of being beaten; the man added:--"You may keep this paper as your receipt."Thenardier retreated in tolerably good order."This signature is fairly well imitated," he growled between his teeth;"however, let it go!"Then he essayed a desperate effort."It is well, sir," he said, "since you are the person, but I must bepaid for all those little things. A great deal is owing to me."The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his thread-baresleeve:--"Monsieur Thenardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owedyou one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill offive hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end ofFebruary, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since thennine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreedupon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs. You had receivedone hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five still owing you. Ihave just given you fifteen hundred francs."Thenardier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when hefeels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap."Who is this devil of a man?" he thought.He did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded withhim once."Monsieur-I-don't-know-your-name," he said resolutely, and this timecasting aside all respectful ceremony, "I shall take back Cosette if youdo not give me a thousand crowns."The stranger said tranquilly:--"Come, Cosette."He took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up hiscudgel, which was lying on the ground.Thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of thespot.The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keepermotionless and speechless.While they were walking away, Thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders,which were a little rounded, and his great fists.Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon hisfeeble arms and his thin hands. "I really must have been exceedinglystupid not to have thought to bring my gun," he said to himself, "sinceI was going hunting!"However, the inn-keeper did not give up."I want to know where he is going," said he, and he set out to followthem at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony inthe shape of the paper signed Fantine, and a consolation, the fifteenhundred francs.The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walkedslowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness.The winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thenardier did not losethem from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turnedround from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed.All at once he caught sight of Thenardier. He plunged suddenly intothe brushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. "Thedeuce!" said Thenardier, and he redoubled his pace.The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. Whenthe man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeledround. It was in vain that Thenardier sought to conceal himself in thebranches; he could not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon himan uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course. Theinn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two orthree hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he sawthe inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air thatThenardier decided that it was "useless" to proceed further. Thenardierretraced his steps.CHAPTER XI--NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERYJean Valjean was not dead.When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, hewas not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached avessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hidinghimself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, andreached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lackmoney, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhoodof Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--alucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitiveswho are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality,pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his firstrefuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towardsGrand-Villard, near Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling anduneasy flight,--a mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable. Lateron, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux,was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot calledGrange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs ofPerigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris.We have just seen him at Montfermeil.His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothesfor a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procurea lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It willbe remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made amysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which thelaw had gathered an inkling.However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased theobscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journalswhich chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured andalmost at peace, as though he had really been dead.On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from theclaws of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it atnightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. Therehe entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of theObservatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette bythe hand, and together they directed their steps through thedarkness,--through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and theGlaciere, towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital.The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. Theyhad eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behindhedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled shortdistances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and JeanValjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his handas she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting goof Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean's shoulder, and there fellasleep.BOOK FOURTH.--THE GORBEAU HOVEL[Illustration: The Gorbeau Hovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-house]CHAPTER I--MASTER GORBEAUForty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country ofthe Salpetriere, and who had mounted to the Barriere d'Italie by wayof the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Parisdisappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; itwas not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not thecity, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew inthem; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it,then? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desertplace where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, astreet of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by daythan a cemetery.It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux.The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls ofthis Marche-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue duPetit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by highwalls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaverhuts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long,low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning,laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring; then,in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on whichran the inscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,--this daringrambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of theRue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, and between twogarden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building,which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, andwhich was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It presented its sideand gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearlythe whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and one window could beseen.This hovel was only one story high.The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could neverhave been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if ithad been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry,might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly boundtogether by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. Itopened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, whichcould be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder anddisappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapelessbay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in thecentre of which a triangular hole had been sawed, which served both aswicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On the inside of thedoor the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brushdipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed thenumber 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said,"Number 50"; the inside replied, "no, Number 52." No one knows whatdust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangularopening.The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetianblinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large paneswere suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed andbetrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated andunpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants.The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naivelyreplaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began asa blind ended as a shutter. This door with an unclean, and this windowwith an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been amendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed whichhad been converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinaltube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts ofcompartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stressof circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambersreceived their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversedaccording as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold raysor by icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sortof dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about theheight of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled upformed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown thereas they passed by.A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what stillremains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days.As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years isyouth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man's lodgingpartook of his ephemeral character, and God's house of his eternity.The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in theneighborhood as the Gorbeau house.Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, andprick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that therewas in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at theChatelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The twonames had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too finefor the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediatelyput in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses thatlimped a little:--          Maitre Corbeau, sur un dossier perche,[13]               Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire;          Maitre Renard, par l'odeur alleche,               Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire:                    He! bonjour.  Etc.The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding thebearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter whichfollowed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon theexpedient of applying to the king.Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when thePapal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on theother, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in hisMajesty's presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, whohad just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh,passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed onthese limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By the kingscommand, Maitre Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initialletter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maitre Renard was less lucky; all heobtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to call himselfPrenard; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as thefirst.Now, according to local tradition, this Maitre Gorbeau had been theproprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l'Hopital.He was even the author of the monumental window.Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elmwhich was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Ruede la Barriere des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to theseason, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odorof copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still inexistence.This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was theroad to Bicetre. It was through it that, under the Empire and theRestoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the dayof their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed thatmysterious assassination, called "The assassination of the Fontainebleaubarrier," whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholyproblem which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which hasnever been unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal RueCroulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound ofthunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at theabominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that expedientof the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable andshameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, whichrecoiled before the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it withgrandeur, nor to uphold it with authority.Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the mostmournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago,was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood thebuilding Number 50-52.Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts whichassailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere,a glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicetre, whose outskirts onewas fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women andthe madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceivenothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a fewfactories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stoodhovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new whitewalls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildingserected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and themelancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground,not a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The ensemble was glacial,regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry. It isbecause symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of grief.Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one suffersmay be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such a hellexisted, that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital might have formed theentrance to it.Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight isvanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breezetears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deepand starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in theclouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenlybecomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in theshades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain fromrecalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connectedwith the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes havebeen committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had apresentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confusedforms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, ofwhich one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day itwas ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seatedat the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good oldwomen were fond of begging.However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antiqueair, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any onewho was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail ofthe whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the stationof the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distractedit, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of acapital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of acity. It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements ofa people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf theancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at therattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstroushorses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old housescrumble and new ones rise.Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere,the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and theJardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three orfour times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuseswhich, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left;for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact;and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes thesouthern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that thefrequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a newlife are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks,the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to growlonger, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,--amemorable morning in July, 1845,--black pots of bitumen were seensmoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization hadarrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that Paris had entered the suburbof Saint-Marceau.CHAPTER II--A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLERIt was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. Likewild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key,opened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended thestaircase, still carrying Cosette.At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, withwhich he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and whichhe closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic,furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and severalchairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers werevisible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vaguelight into this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-roomwith a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laidher down there without waking her.He struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared beforehandon the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, he beganto scrutinize Cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which theexpression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration. Thelittle girl, with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extremestrength and extreme weakness, had fallen asleep without knowing withwhom she was, and continued to sleep without knowing where she was.Jean Valjean bent down and kissed that child's hand.Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had alsojust fallen asleep.The same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.He knelt beside Cosette's bed.lt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of theDecember sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon theceiling in long threads of light and shade. All at once a heavily ladencarrier's cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frailbed, like a clap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom."Yes, madame!" cried Cosette, waking with a start, "here I am! here Iam!"And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heavinessof sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall."Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!" said she.She opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of JeanValjean."Ah! so it is true!" said the child. "Good morning, Monsieur."Children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, beingthemselves by nature joy and happiness.Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and tookpossession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions toJean Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame Thenardiervery far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once she exclaimed,"How pretty it is here!"It was a frightful hole, but she felt free."Must I sweep?" she resumed at last."Play!" said Jean Valjean.The day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understandanything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.CHAPTER III--TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNEOn the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still byCosette's bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.Some new thing had come into his soul.Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had beenalone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. Inthe prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy.The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister and hissister's children had left him only a vague and far-off memory whichhad finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort tofind them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them.Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if hehad ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried heroff, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards thatchild. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled withjoy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what itmeant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins tolove is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all thatmight have been love in the whole course of his life flowed togetherinto a sort of ineffable light.It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishophad caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused thedawn of love to rise.The early days passed in this dazzled state.Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become anotherbeing, poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her,that she no longer remembered her. Like all children, who resemble youngshoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love;she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,--the Thenardiers, theirchildren, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, afterwhich nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It is a sadthing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight years ofage, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the facultyof loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from thevery first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kindman. She felt that which she had never felt before--a sensation ofexpansion.The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; shethought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty ofthe earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charmingas the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in ourpast a delightful garret.Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf betweenJean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. Destiny suddenlyunited and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprootedexistences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completedthe other. Cosette's instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean'sinstinct sought a child. To meet was to find each other. At themysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together.When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other asnecessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, wemay say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, JeanValjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situationcaused Jean Valjean to become Cosette's father after a celestialfashion.And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in thedepths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean graspinghers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance ofthat man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemedperfectly secure.The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, wasthe one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only windowin the house, no neighbors' glances were to be feared from across theway or at the side.The ground-floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse,served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communicationexisted between it and the first story. It was separated by theflooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed thediaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, as wehave said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of whichwas occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean'shousekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal lodger,and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had lethim the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to her as agentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was comingthere to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six months inadvance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber anddressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who had lightedthe fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of theirarrival.Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have theirmorning song as well as birds.It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, allcracked with chilblains, and kissed it. The poor child, who was usedto being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away inconfusion.At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown. Cosettewas no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged from misery,and she was entering into life.Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he madethe child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evilthat he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching achild to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of theangels.He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one whowas not man, and he became absorbed in revery. Good thoughts have theirabysses as well as evil ones.To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearlythe whole of Jean Valjean's existence. And then he talked of her mother,and he made her pray.She called him father, and knew no other name for him.He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and inlistening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be fullof interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproachedany one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a veryold man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole future stretchingout before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light. The bestof us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts. At times, he reflectedwith a sort of joy that she would be ugly.This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at thepoint where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, itis by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement inorder that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed themalice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect--incompleteaspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth,the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority aspersonified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for havingdone right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude wereoverpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffereda temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous andtriumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim.Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growingdiscouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again.Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected her,and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life;thanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child's stay,and she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of thebalances of destiny!CHAPTER IV--THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANTJean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. Every evening,at twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often withCosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, andentering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Medard, which isthe nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remainedwith the old woman; but the child's delight was to go out with the goodman. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-teteswith Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet thingsto her.It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went tomarket.They lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people invery moderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations inthe furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass doorleading to Cosette's dressing-room replaced by a solid door.He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat.In the street, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened thatkind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjeanaccepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that heencountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind himto make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached theunfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silvercoin, and walked rapidly away. This had its disadvantages. He beganto be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who givesalms.The old principal lodger, a cross-looking creature, who wasthoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with theinquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjeana great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf,which rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, twoteeth,--one above, the other below,--which she was continually knockingagainst each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been ableto tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that she hadcome from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, withan air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of theuninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the stepof an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through acrack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had hisback turned towards this door, by way of greater security, no doubt. Theold woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case, scissors,and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of hiscoat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which heunfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it wasa bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second or third only thatshe had seen in the course of her existence. She fled in alarm.A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go andget this thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was hisquarterly income, which he had received the day before. "Where?" thoughtthe old woman. "He did not go out until six o'clock in the evening, andthe government bank certainly is not open at that hour." The oldwoman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. Thatthousand-franc note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vastamount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des VignesSaint-Marcel.A few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, inhis shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber,putting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied in admiringthe wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the coat hangingon a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up again. The goodwoman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts andrevers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt!She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets.Not only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a bigpocket-book, a very large knife, and--a suspicious circumstance--severalwigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air of being ina manner provided against unexpected accidents.Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.CHAPTER V--A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULTNear Saint-Medard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit ofcrouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, andon whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed thisman without giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. Those whoenvied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He was anex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosettewith him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lanternwhich had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, accordingto his custom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to himand placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant raised hiseyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his headquickly. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean wasseized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had just caught sight,by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and beamingvisage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. Heexperienced the same impression that one would have on finding one'sself, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. Herecoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak,to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head,which was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared to know that hewas there. At this strange moment, an instinct--possibly the mysteriousinstinct of self-preservation,--restrained Jean Valjean from uttering aword. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearanceas he had every day. "Bah!" said Jean Valjean, "I am mad! I am dreaming!Impossible!" And he returned profoundly troubled.He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which hethought he had seen was the face of Javert.That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not havingquestioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a secondtime.On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at hispost. "Good day, my good man," said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handinghim a sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,"Thanks, my good sir." It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. "How thedeuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?" he thought. "Am Igoing to lose my eyesight now?" And he thought no more about it.A few days afterwards,--it might have been at eight o'clock in theevening,--he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud,when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck himas singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the houseexcept himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might notburn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the oldwoman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's.Jean Valjean listened.The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old womanwore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles thestep of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blewout his candle.He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, "Get into bedvery softly"; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards thedoor, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding hisbreath in the dark.After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as heheard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of hischamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sortof sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There wasevidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand andlistening.Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard nosound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who hadbeen listening at the door had removed his shoes.Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and couldnot close his eyes all night.At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he wasawakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at theend of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which hadascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching.He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which wastolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way by nightinto the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was aman, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front of JeanValjean's chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the person'sface being distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, aray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and JeanValjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature,clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidableneck and shoulders belonged to Javert.Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of himthrough his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have beenobliged to open the window: he dared not.It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself.Who had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o'clock in the morning,Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not questionher. The good woman appeared as usual.As she swept up she remarked to him:--"Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?"At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o'clock in the evening was thedead of the night."That is true, by the way," he replied, in the most natural tonepossible. "Who was it?""It was a new lodger who has come into the house," said the old woman."And what is his name?""I don't know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.""And who is this Monsieur Dumont?"The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:--"A gentleman of property, like yourself."Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceivedone.When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. Inspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that hemight not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from hishands and rolled noisily on the floor.When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both sidesof the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be absolutelydeserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees.He went up stairs again."Come." he said to Cosette.He took her by the hand, and they both went out.BOOK FIFTH.--FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACKCHAPTER I--THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGYAn observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which thereader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with furtheron.The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioninghimself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has beentransformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, aftera fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he lovesParis: Paris is his mind's natal city. In consequence of demolitions andreconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore awayreligiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He mustbe permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It ispossible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says,"In such a street there stands such and such a house," neither streetnor house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verifythe facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he isunacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris beforehis eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to himto dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which hebeheld when he was in his own country, and that all has not vanished.So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine that thosestreets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows,those roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls arestrangers to you; that those trees are merely the first encounteredhaphazard; that those houses, which you do not enter, are useless toyou; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on,when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear toyou; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and that those walls arenecessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that you enteredthose houses which you never entered, every day, and that you have lefta part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.All those places which you no longer behold, which you may neverbehold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take ona melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of anapparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak,the very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as theyare, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to nochange: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to theface of your mother.May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? Thatsaid, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into thestreets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise,returning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not beingfollowed.[Illustration: The Black Hunt  2b5-1-black-hunt]This manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where animprint of the track may be left, this manoeuvre possesses, among otheradvantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwingthem on the wrong scent. In venery this is called false re-imbushment.The moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. Themoon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light andshadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to thehouses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He didnot, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that thedark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near theRue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of thefirst six years of her life had instilled something passive into hernature. Moreover,--and this is a remark to which we shall frequentlyhave occasion to recur,--she had grown used, without being herselfaware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks ofdestiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. Hetrusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also wereclinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought hefelt a being leading him, though invisible. However, he had no settledidea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it wasJavert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing thathe was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to bedead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. He wantedno more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.Like the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole inwhich he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetardquarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of theMiddle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined invarious manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the RueCopeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l'Ermite.There are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enterone, finding nothing which suited him. He had no doubt that if any onehad chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.As eleven o'clock struck from Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, he was traversingthe Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police,situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we havespoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw distinctly,thanks to the commissary's lantern, which betrayed them, three menwho were following him closely, pass, one after the other, under thatlantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three entered thealley leading to the commissary's house. The one who marched at theirhead struck him as decidedly suspicious."Come, child," he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the RuePontoise.He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which wasclosed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l'Epee-de-Boisand the Rue de l'Arbalete, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.At that time there was a square formed by the intersection ofstreets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the RueNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve turns off.It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve is anold street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue desPostes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Posteswas inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went intoambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still followinghim, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversedthis illuminated space.In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made theirappearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long,brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Theirgreat stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarmingthan did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would havepronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men inconsultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to betheir leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in thedirection which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate thecontrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when thefirst man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean Valjeanrecognized Javert perfectly.CHAPTER II--IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGESUncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lastedfor the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost forthem, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he hadconcealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the regionof the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He tookher in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and thestreet lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.He redoubled his pace.In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the frontof which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancientinscription:--               De Goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique;[14]               Venez choisir des cruches et des broos,               Des pots a fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.               A tout venant le Coeur vend des Carreaux.He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached thequay. There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets weredeserted. There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath.He gained the Pont d'Austerlitz.Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou."It is two sous," said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. "You arecarrying a child who can walk. Pay for two."He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. Every flightshould be an imperceptible slipping away.A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and onits way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He couldtraverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,wanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right. Hedirected his course thither. In order to reach them, it was necessary torisk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space.He did not hesitate. Those who were on his track had evidently lost thescent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out of danger. Hunted,yes; followed, no.A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened outbetween two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark andnarrow and seemed made expressly for him. Before entering it he cast aglance behind him.From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pontd'Austerlitz.Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and wereon their way to the right bank.These four shadows were the four men.Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, steppedon the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing thelarge illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, hemight escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, themarket-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent littlestreet. He entered it.CHAPTER III--TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the streetforked. It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line, oneto the right, and the other to the left.Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y.Which should he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on theright.Why?Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towardsinhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, thatis to say, towards deserted regions.However, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette's pace retarded JeanValjean's.He took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on theshoulder of the good man and said not a word.He turned round from time to time and looked behind him. He took care tokeep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straightin his rear. The first two or three times that he turned round he sawnothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhatreassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in theportion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in theobscurity, something which was moving.He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find someside-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scentonce more.He arrived at a wall.This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it wasa wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had takenended.Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to theright or to the left.He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged betweenbuildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind alley.The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,--a lofty whitewall.He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and abouttwo hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was theaffluent. On that side lay safety.At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, inan effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, heperceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the laneand the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps.It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, andwho was barring the passage and waiting.Jean Valjean recoiled.The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated betweenthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Rapee, is one of those which recentimprovements have transformed from top to bottom,--resulting indisfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according toothers. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildingshave been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there;progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is allcompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut lesQuatre-Nations, and the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise spotwhither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit Picpus. ThePorte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barriere des Sergents, thePorcherons, la Galiote, les Celestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe,l'Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne--these are the names of old Pariswhich survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over theserelics of the past.Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, andnever was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkishaspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streetswere not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets,of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Nota shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in thewindows; all lights extinguished after ten o'clock. Gardens, convents,timber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls ashigh as the houses.Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbedit soundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it.Rubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarterwas disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day,it has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existingplan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearnessin the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, RueSaint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Platre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,Rue Merciere, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, aswe have just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue duChemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking onthe left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name ofthe Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apexas by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau endedthere; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoirmarket. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the RuePolonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at aright angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right atruncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and wascalled the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.It was here that Jean Valjean stood.As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouettestanding on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the RuePetit-Picpus, he recoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantomwas lying in wait for him.What was he to do?The time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived inmovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and hissquad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencementof the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to allappearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had takenhis precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. Thesesurmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like ahandful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through JeanValjean's mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there hewas cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.He saw that black form standing out in relief against the whitepavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into thisman's hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert's arms. JeanValjean felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting;he gazed heavenward in despair.CHAPTER IV--THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHTIn order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exactidea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which oneleaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into thislane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as faras the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by asolitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts whichgrew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the RuePetit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on theRue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the RuePolonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended tosuch a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abutdirectly on the Street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealedby its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in theRue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along theRue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along theRue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomybuilding which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thusforming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombreof aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more correctly, twoshutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.The state of the places of which we are here giving a description isrigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in themind of old inhabitants of the quarter.The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossaland wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicularplanks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together bylong transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate ofthe ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more thanfifty years previously.A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was coveredwith ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombrebuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him.He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he couldcontrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived anidea, then a hope.In the central portion of the front of this building, on the RueDroit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different storiesancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes whichled from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sortof tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundredelbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over thefronts of old farm-houses.This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the firstthing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back againsta stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot wherethe conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbingup by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and pastservice, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windowsof this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the atticwindows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that facade, andthe man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seenJean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be donewith Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-storyhouse?He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawledalong the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, henoticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, hewas concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they wereapproaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there weretwo doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw thelinden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, atleast, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees,and spend the remainder of the night.Time was passing; he must act quickly.He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact thatit was impracticable outside and in.He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfullydecrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks wererotten; the iron bands--there were only three of them--were rusted. Itseemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier.On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neitherhinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bandstraversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevicesin the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stoneroughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen thereten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that thisapparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building againstwhich it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, onefound one's self face to face with a wall.CHAPTER V--WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNSAt that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at somedistance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouchedinto the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They wereadvancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguishedJavert's tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They haltedfrequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of thewalls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.This was some patrol that Javert had encountered--there could be nomistake as to this surmise--and whose aid he had demanded.Javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks.At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of thehalts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter ofan hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightfulmoment. A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terribleprecipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleysnow meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that isto say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.There was but one thing which was possible.Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say,two beggar's pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the otherthe redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or theother, according to circumstances.Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from theprison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in theincredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheermuscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, hiships, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of thestone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if needbe; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that cornerof the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemnedto death, made his escape twenty years ago.Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied thelinden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formedwith the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity,by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended topreserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirtycreatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners ofthe wall is much in use in Paris.This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit ofthis mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteenfeet.The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. Itwas impossible to carry her. A man's whole strength is required tosuccessfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden woulddisturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he toget a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjeanhad had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimesdazzle, sometimes illuminate us.Jean Valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of theblind alley Genrot.At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. Atnightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they wereascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the streetfrom side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulleyover which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a littleiron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the ropeitself was protected by a metal case.Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the streetat one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little boxwith the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosetteonce more. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients workrapidly when they are fighting against fatality.We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted thatnight. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without evennoticing that it was no longer in its place.Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean'sabsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had begunto render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given ventto loud shrieks long before. She contented herself with plucking JeanValjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of thepatrol's approach ever more and more distinctly."Father," said she, in a very low voice, "I am afraid. Who is comingyonder?""Hush!" replied the unhappy man; "it is Madame Thenardier."Cosette shuddered. He added:--"Say nothing. Don't interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, theThenardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back."Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firmand curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol andJavert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed itround Cosette's body under the armpits, taking care that it should nothurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means ofthat knot which seafaring men call a "swallow knot," took the other endof the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, whichhe threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and beganto raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as muchsolidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under hisfeet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting onhis knees on the wall.Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. JeanValjean's injunction, and the name of Madame Thenardier, had chilled herblood.All at once she heard Jean Valjean's voice crying to her, though in avery low tone:--"Put your back against the wall."She obeyed."Don't say a word, and don't be alarmed," went on Jean Valjean.And she felt herself lifted from the ground.Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny handsin his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled alongon top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stooda building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade anddescended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentleslope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wallwas much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean couldonly see the ground at a great depth below him.He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left thecrest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of thepatrol. The thundering voice of Javert was audible:--"Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the RuePetit-Picpus. I'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley."The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fastto Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whetherfrom terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though herhands were a little abraded.CHAPTER VI--THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMAJean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast andof singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made tobe looked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape,with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall foresttrees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where couldbe seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarledand bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whoseglass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here andthere stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys werebordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had halftaken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him asa means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directlyagainst the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longeranything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through thegloom.The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers weredistinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as ashed.The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the RuePetit-Picpus, turned two facades, at right angles, towards this garden.These interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior. Allthe windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one ofthem. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those facadescast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immenseblack pall.No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mistand darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, whichintersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and thelow roofs of the Rue Polonceau.Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. Therewas no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but itdid not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in, evenin broad daylight.Jean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put themon again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeingnever thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose thoughts werestill on the Thenardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sightas much as possible.Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuousnoise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blowsof their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert's appeals to the policespies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with words whichcould not be distinguished.At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though thatspecies of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held hisbreath.He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette's mouth.However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that thisfrightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him by somuch as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls hadbeen built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; asound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had beenhorrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burstof prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;women's voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pureaccents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,--voices whichare not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infantstill hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceededfrom the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the momentwhen the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir ofangels was approaching through the gloom.Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both ofthem, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt thatthey must kneel.These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not preventthe building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant inan uninhabited house.While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He nolonger beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that hefelt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean couldnot have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street;there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which hadreassured him,--all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weedson the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholysound.CHAPTER VII--CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMAThe night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between oneand two o'clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she hadseated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjeanhad fancied that she was asleep. He bent down and looked at her.Cosette's eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained JeanValjean.She was still trembling."Are you sleepy?" said Jean Valjean."I am very cold," she replied.A moment later she resumed:--"Is she still there?""Who?" said Jean Valjean."Madame Thenardier."Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed tomake Cosette keep silent."Ah!" said he, "she is gone. You need fear nothing further."The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew morekeen every instant. The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it roundCosette."Are you less cold now?" said he."Oh, yes, father.""Well, wait for me a moment. I will soon be back."He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a bettershelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars atall the windows of the ground floor.Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observedthat he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They allopened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut upby arcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows werevisible. The light came from a taper which was burning in onecorner. The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on theground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, andwhich resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flaton the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in theimmobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of serpentwhich undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope roundits neck.The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparelyilluminated, which adds to horror.Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funerealspectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything moreblood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishingsome inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus atnight. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; andstill more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive.He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watchwhether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemedto him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. Allat once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and hefled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him.It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that formfollowing him with great strides and waving its arms.He reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way beneathhim; the perspiration was pouring from him.Where was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort ofsepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edificefull of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness withthe voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly thatterrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, andthen opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was anedifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream!He had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact.Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him agenuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.He stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep.CHAPTER VIII--THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUSThe child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazedat her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he shouldneed nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. Hewas not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off hiscoat to cover her.Nevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heardfor some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. Thissound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly thoughfaintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells ofcattle at night in the pastures.This noise made Valjean turn round.He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melonbeds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though hewere dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This personappeared to limp.Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. Forthem everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the daybecause it enables people to see them, and the night because it aidsin surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because thegarden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some onethere.He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himselfthat Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; thatthey had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if thisman should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help againstthieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in hisarms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out ofuse, in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir.From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in themelon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bellfollowed each of this man's movements. When the man approached, thesound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if hemade any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when hehalted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attachedto that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who had abell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette's hands. Theywere icy cold."Ah! good God!" he cried.He spoke to her in a low voice:--"Cosette!"She did not open her eyes.He shook her vigorously.She did not wake."Is she dead?" he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quiveringfrom head to foot.The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. Thereare moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, andviolently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are inquestion, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered thatsleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at hisfeet, without a movement.He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respirationwhich seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All thatwas not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildlyfrom the ruin.It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside afire in less than a quarter of an hour.CHAPTER IX--THE MAN WITH THE BELLHe walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had takenin his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.The man's head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In afew strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:--"One hundred francs!"The man gave a start and raised his eyes."You can earn a hundred francs," went on Jean Valjean, "if you willgrant me shelter for this night."The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean's terrified countenance."What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!" said the man.That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot,by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.He had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him wasa bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on hisleft knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. Hisface, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling allover:--"Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter?Dieu-Jesus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that:if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in!You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you know, youwould have frightened any one who did not know you? No coat! Lord God!Are the saints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?"His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rusticvolubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was utteredwith a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness."Who are you? and what house is this?" demanded Jean Valjean."Ah! pardieu, this is too much!" exclaimed the old man. "I am the personfor whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you hadme placed. What! You don't recognize me?""No," said Jean Valjean; "and how happens it that you know me?""You saved my life," said the man.He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjeanrecognized old Fauchelevent."Ah!" said Jean Valjean, "so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.""That is very lucky," said the old man, in a reproachful tone."And what are you doing here?" resumed Jean Valjean."Why, I am covering my melons, of course!"In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Faucheleventheld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied inspreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he hadbeen in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It wasthis operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movementsobserved from the shed by Jean Valjean.He continued:--"I said to myself, 'The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if Iwere to put my melons into their greatcoats?' And," he added, looking atJean Valjean with a broad smile,--"pardieu! you ought to have done thesame! But how do you come here?"Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under thename of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multipliedhis questions. Strange to say, their roles seemed to be reversed. It washe, the intruder, who interrogated."And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?""This," replied Fauchelevent, "is so that I may be avoided.""What! so that you may be avoided?"Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air."Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many young girls. Itappears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives themwarning. When I come, they go.""What house is this?""Come, you know well enough.""But I do not.""Not when you got me the place here as gardener?""Answer me as though I knew nothing.""Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent."Memories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence,had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoinewhere old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had beenadmitted on his recommendation two years previously. He repeated, asthough talking to himself:--"The Petit-Picpus convent.""Exactly," returned old Fauchelevent. "But to come to the point, how thedeuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter ifyou are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.""You certainly are here.""There is no one but me.""Still," said Jean Valjean, "I must stay here.""Ah, good God!" cried Fauchelevent.Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a gravevoice:--"Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.""I was the first to recall it," returned Fauchelevent."Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the oldendays."Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands JeanValjean's two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as thoughincapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:--"Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make yousome little return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, disposeof the old man!"A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed toemit a ray of light."What do you wish me to do?" he resumed."That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?""I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent,in a corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it."The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverlyarranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceivedit."Good," said Jean Valjean. "Now I am going to ask two things of you.""What are they, Mr. Mayor?""In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me.In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.""As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest,that you have always been a man after the good God's heart. And then,moreover, you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at yourservice.""That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the child.""Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "so there is a child?"He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog followshis master.Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy againbefore the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener'sbed. Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat,which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up. WhileJean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed thebell and kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket thatadorned the wall. The two men were warming themselves with their elbowsresting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese,black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man wassaying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter's knee:"Ah! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you savepeople's lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they rememberyou! You are an ingrate!"CHAPTER X--WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENTThe events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak,had come about in the simplest possible manner.When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert hadarrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town jailof M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself toParis. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everythingdisappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. Noforest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort knowthis. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. Thepolice know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what theyhave lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert wassummoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, infact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.Javert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked byM. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Angles. M.Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's patron, had theinspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. ThereJavert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seemstrange for such services, honorable manners.He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day causes thesedogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,--when,in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers;but Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars ofthe triumphal entry of the "Prince Generalissimo" into Bayonne. Just ashe was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name ofJean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The paperannounced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the factin such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined himselfto the remark, "That's a good entry." Then he threw aside the paper, andthought no more about it.Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmittedfrom the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police inParis, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, underpeculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil.A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who hadbeen intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, hadbeen stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette,and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in thehospital, it was not known where or when.This report came under Javert's eye and set him to thinking.The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that JeanValjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for arespite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature'schild. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Parisat the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil.Some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the secondoccasion of his entering that coach, and that he had already, on theprevious day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village, forhe had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been intendingto do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised.Javert understood it now. Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean wasgoing there in search of her. And now this child had been stolen by astranger! Who could that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But JeanValjean was dead. Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took thecoach from the Pewter Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made atrip to Montfermeil.He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he founda great deal of obscurity.For the first few days the Thenardiers had chattered in their rage. Thedisappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. Heimmediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in theabduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexationhaving passed off, Thenardier, with his wonderful instinct, hadvery quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up theprosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to theabduction of Cosette would have as their first result to fix uponhimself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the glitteringeye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a candlebrought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundredfrancs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag onhis wife's mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child wasmentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt he hadgrumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature "taken from him"so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer,out of tenderness; but her "grandfather" had come for her in the mostnatural way in the world. He added the "grandfather," which produced agood effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived atMontfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, intoThenardier's history. "Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?"Thenardier replied with simplicity: "He is a wealthy farmer. I saw hispassport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert."Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javertreturned to Paris."Jean Valjean is certainly dead," said he, "and I am a ninny."He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course ofMarch, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish ofSaint-Medard and who had been surnamed "the mendicant who gives alms."This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knewexactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, whoknew nothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil.Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prickup his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this personhad given alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property wasvery shy,--never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one,except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approachhim. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth manymillions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert'scuriosity in a decided manner. In order to get a close look at thisfantastic gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle'soutfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in the habit ofcrouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, and playingthe spy under cover of prayer."The suspected individual" did indeed approach Javert thus disguised,and bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and theshock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to theone received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's death wasofficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert,the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one's collar.He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got "the old woman" totalking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the factregarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episodeof the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javerthired a room; that evening he installed himself in it. He came andlistened at the mysterious lodger's door, hoping to catch the sound ofhis voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, andfoiled the spy by keeping silent.On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by thefall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearingthe rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, andmade haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javertwas waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had notmentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that washis secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escapeand was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classedforever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort, was amagnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police wouldassuredly not leave to a new-comer like Javert, and he was afraid ofbeing deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being anartist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heraldedsuccesses which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloombrushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark andto unveil them suddenly at the last.Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from cornerto corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a singleinstant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself tobe the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. Why had not Javertarrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still in doubt.It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not preciselyat its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrestsdenounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, andhad rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual libertywas a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a mistake;the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. Thereader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproducedby twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: "Yesterday, an agedgrandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman,who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested andconducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!"Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own;injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of theprefect. He was really in doubt.Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of beingforced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosetteand himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace ofthe child--all this, without his being aware of it, had altered JeanValjean's walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that thepolice themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did infact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, hiscostume of an emigre preceptor, the declaration of Thenardier which madea grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in prison,added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert'smind.For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for hispapers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not agood, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merryblade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisianmisdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to concealhis other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows,accomplices' retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, nodoubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making through thestreets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man. Toarrest him too hastily would be "to kill the hen that laid the goldeneggs." Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure thathe would not escape.Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting tohimself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to thebrilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized JeanValjean.There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,--themother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.Javert gave that profound start.As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidableconvict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he askedfor reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. Oneputs on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with hisagents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined,however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between hispursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-houndwho puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the rightscent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight tothe bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him withthe information which he required: "Have you seen a man with a littlegirl?" "I made him pay two sous," replied the toll-keeper. Javertreached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the smallilluminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette bythe hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; heremembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of thesole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sureof his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of hisagents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which wasreturning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisitionon it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces.Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wildboar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. Thesecombinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caughtbetween the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, andhimself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment;he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, butdesirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happyat the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloatingover him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider whichallows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the mouse run.Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,--the obscure movementsof the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight thisstrangling is!Javert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted.He was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his hand.Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible,however vigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might be.[Illustration: Javert on the Hunt  2b5-10-javert-on-the-hunt]Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks ofthe street like so many pockets of thieves.When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.His exasperation can be imagined.He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus;that agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen theman pass.It sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that is tosay, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then theoldest huntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, and Desprezhalt short. In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims, "It wasnot a stag, but a sorcerer." Javert would have liked to utter the samecry.His disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia,that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Caesar mademistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the warin Scythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign against JeanValjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of theexconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong innot arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrongin not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the Rue dePontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in thefull light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainlyuseful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogswho deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he ischasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by takingtoo much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack onthe trail, alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart, and somade him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he had picked up thescent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable andpuerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thoughthimself stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at thegame of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himselfas too weak, when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement. Fatalprecaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed all these blunders,and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies thatever existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what is called invenery a knowing dog. But what is there that is perfect?Great strategists have their eclipses.The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, ofa multitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all thepetty determining motives separately, and you can break them one afterthe other, and you say, "That is all there is of it!" Braid them, twistthem together; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating betweenMarcian on the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal tarryingat Capua; it is Danton falling asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjeanhad escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict whohad broken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels, heorganized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. Thefirst thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose ropehad been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since itcaused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-SacGenrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abuttedon gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land.Jean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is,that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, hewould probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored thesegardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for aneedle.At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned tothe Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had beencaptured by a robber might have been.BOOK SIXTH.--LE PETIT-PICPUSCHAPTER I--NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUSNothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gatethan the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance,which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted aview of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal aboutthem,--a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the faceof a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, talltrees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, whena glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression ofit. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,--which waseven nearly impossible for every one, for there was an open sesame!which it was necessary to know,--if, the porter once passed, one entereda little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut inbetween two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it ata time, if one did not allow one's self to be alarmed by a daubing ofcanary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, ifone ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second,and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash andthe chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency.Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. Thecorridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, onearrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all themore mysterious because it was not fastened. If one opened it, onefound one's self in a little chamber about six feet square, tiled,well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with greenflowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a largewindow, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole widthof the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heardneither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamberwas not furnished; there was not even a chair.One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangularhole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars,black, knotted, solid, which formed squares--I had almost saidmeshes--of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The littlegreen flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner tothose iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion bytheir funereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been sowonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the squarehole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passageof the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is tosay, of the mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had beenre-enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear,and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes ofa strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been piercedexactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attachedto a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near athand, which made one start."Who is there?" the voice demanded.It was a woman's voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. Ifone did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more,as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the otherside of it.If one knew the password, the voice resumed, "Enter on the right."One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass doorsurmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch andcrossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impressionas when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire, before thegrating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, ina sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and amuch-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light fromthe glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to leanupon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, onlythe grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was amonstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to thewall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.The first minutes passed; when one's eyes began to grow used to thiscellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got nofurther than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier ofblack shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of woodpainted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long,narrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. Theywere always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voiceproceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:--"I am here. What do you wish with me?"It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. Hardlythe sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spiritwhich had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of thetomb.If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions,the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spiritbecame an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, oneperceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which onlythe mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a blackveil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barelydefined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but didnot look at you and never smiled at you.The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner thatyou saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light wassymbolical.Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening whichwas made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vaguenessenveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness,and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At theexpiration of a very short time you discovered that you could seenothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mistmingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silencefrom which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in whichyou could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was calledthe Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box inwhich you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed youwas that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on theother side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the irongrating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that theparlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on theside of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light;there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the moststrictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way intoit, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing theproper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and have,therefore, never described.CHAPTER II--THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGAThis convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year inthe Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience ofMartin Verga.These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, likethe Bernardine monks, but to Citeaux, like the Benedictine monks. Inother words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of SaintBenoit.Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that MartinVerga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines,with Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branchestablishment.This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholiccountries of Europe.There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of oneorder on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoit, whichis here in question: there are attached to this order, without countingthe obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,--two in Italy,Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny andSaint-Maur; and nine orders,--Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Celestins,the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humilies, the Olivateurs, theSilvestrins, and lastly, Citeaux; for Citeaux itself, a trunk for otherorders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoit. Citeaux dates from SaintRobert, Abbe de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it wasin 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco--hewas old--had he turned hermit?--was chased from the ancient temple ofApollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoit, then aged seventeen.After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willowon their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of theBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command ofSaint-Benoit, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves,a large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square onthe breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,--thisis their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. Thenovices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns alsowear a rosary at their side.The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the PerpetualAdoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,--one atthe Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve. However, theBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve and at the Temple. Therewere numerous differences in their rule; there were some in theircostume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore theblack guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of theRue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, and had, besides, on theirbreasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt orgilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this HolySacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house ofthe Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two ordersperfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of theLadies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, justas there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification ofall the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of JesusChrist and the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless,widely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy,established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France,established by Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed theprecedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was acardinal.Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the yearround, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which arepeculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o'clockin the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in allseasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath,never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule ofsilence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which arevery brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, fromSeptember 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter.These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, butthis drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced feversand nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with thispalliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September,they suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty,chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,--these are their vows, whichthe rule greatly aggravates.The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are calledmeres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress canonly be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of aprioress at nine years.They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from themby a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when thepreacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. Theymust always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and theirheads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,--thearchbishop of the diocese.There is really one other,--the gardener. But he is always an old man,and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that thenuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is thecanonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at thevoice of Christ, ut voci Christi, at a gesture, at the first sign,ad nutum, ad primum signum, immediately, with cheerfulness, withperseverance, with a certain blind obedience, prompte, hilariter,perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia, as the file in the hand of theworkman, quasi limam in manibus fabri, without power to read or to writewithout express permission, legere vel scribere non addiscerit sineexpressa superioris licentia.Each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation. The reparationis the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all thedissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for all thecrimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive hours,from four o'clock in the afternoon till four o'clock in the morning, orfrom four o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon,the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stonebefore the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope around her neck.When her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostrates herself flat onher face against the earth, with her arms outstretched in the form of across; this is her only relief. In this attitude she prays for all theguilty in the universe. This is great to sublimity.As this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, itis called without distinction, to make reparation or to be at the post.The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression, whichcontains an idea of torture and abasement.To make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed.The sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to falldirectly behind her.Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the HolySacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other likesoldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.The prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped withpeculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but momentsin the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception,Mother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are notinterdicted.When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent.Brushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is theloss of one's soul.They never say my. They possess nothing of their own, and they must notattach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil,our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say ourchemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,--to a bookof hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as they becomeaware that they are growing attached to this object, they must give itup. They recall the words of Saint Therese, to whom a great lady said,as she was on the point of entering her order, "Permit me, mother, tosend for a Bible to which I am greatly attached." "Ah, you are attachedto something! In that case, do not enter our order!"Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have a placeof her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. When they meet,one says, "Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!"The other responds, "Forever." The same ceremony when one taps at theother's door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on theother side is heard to say hastily, "Forever!" Like all practices, thisbecomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says foreverbefore the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, "Praisedand adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar."Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: "Ave Maria," and the onewhose cell is entered says, "Gratia plena." It is their way of sayinggood day, which is in fact full of grace.At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from thechurch bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers,professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what theyare saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all sayin unison if it is five o'clock, for instance, "At five o'clock and atall hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!"If it is eight o'clock, "At eight o'clock and at all hours!" and so on,according to the hour.This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thoughtand to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; theformula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, "At thishour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!" TheBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago atPetit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorianchant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office.Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say ina low voice, "Jesus-Marie-Joseph." For the office of the dead they adopta tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such adepth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altarfor the burial of their community. The Government, as they say, does notpermit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when theydie. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation as aninfraction of the rules.They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,--permission to beinterred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancientVaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belongedto their community.On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as onSunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivalsunknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was soprodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spainand Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for thenumber and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea ofthem than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: "The prayersof the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are stillworse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse."Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocalmothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confessesaloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she hascommitted during the week. The vocal mothers consult after eachconfession and inflict the penance aloud.Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in theleast serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences whatthey call the coulpe. To make one's coulpe means to prostrate one's selfflat on one's face during the office in front of the prioress untilthe latter, who is never called anything but our mother, notifies theculprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall thatshe can rise. The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter--abroken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at anoffice, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and the coulpeis made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable personherself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judgesherself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays fourmother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk withfour places. One day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalmbeginning with Ecce, and instead of Ecce she uttered aloud the threenotes do si sol; for this piece of absent-mindedness she underwent acoulpe which lasted during the whole service: what rendered the faultenormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself,she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her mouth isvisible.The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others cansee only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance,an outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has known andloved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required.If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nuncomes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened onlyfor a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission isalways refused to men.Such is the rule of Saint-Benoit, aggravated by Martin Verga.These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of otherorders often are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 threeof them went mad.CHAPTER III--AUSTERITIESOne is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice forfour. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronouncedearlier than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. TheBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to theirorder.In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations,of which they must never speak.On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in herhandsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brusheduntil it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great blackveil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then thenuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying inplaintive accents, "Our sister is dead"; and the other file responds ina voice of ecstasy, "Our sister is alive in Jesus Christ!"At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attachedto the convent--a boarding-school for young girls of noble andmostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoisellede Saint-Aulaire and de Belissen, and an English girl bearing theillustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by thesenuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of theage. One of them said to us one day, "The sight of the street pavementmade me shudder from head to foot." They were dressed in blue, with awhite cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast.On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha's day, theywere permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dressthemselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice ofSaint-Benoit for a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in thehabit of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, andthe prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted to lend. It isremarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt,in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in orderto give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuinehappiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amusedthemselves with it. It was new; it gave them a change. Candid reasonsof childhood, which do not, however, succeed in making us worldlingscomprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's handand standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front ofa reading-desk.The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all thepractices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who enteredthe world, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded inbreaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever anyone knocked at her door, "forever!" Like the nuns, the pupils sawtheir relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtainpermission to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degreeseverity on that point was carried. One day a young girl received avisit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister threeyears of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly to embraceher sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might bepermitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she couldkiss it. This was almost indignantly refused.CHAPTER IV--GAYETIESNone the less, these young girls filled this grave house with charmingsouvenirs.At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreationhour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, "Good;here come the children!" An irruption of youth inundated that gardenintersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads,innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scatteredabout amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals,and knells and offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on asudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened,and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each other,they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white teethchattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from adistance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Stillthey beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their momentof dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with thereflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It waslike a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning. The younggirls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccabilitydoes not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was,among so many austere hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little onesskipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play was mingledwith heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh,expanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh withPerrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise,cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinklesof all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of thefairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottagefrom Hecuba to la Mere-Grand.In that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those children'ssayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full ofthoughtfulness. It was between those four gloomy walls that a child offive years exclaimed one day: "Mother! one of the big girls has justtold me that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remainhere. What happiness!"It was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:--A Vocal Mother. Why are you weeping, my child?The child (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. Shesays that I do not know it, but I do.Alix, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.The Mother. How is that, my child?Alix. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any questionin the book, and she would answer it."Well?""She did not answer it.""Let us see about it. What did you ask her?""I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the firstquestion that I came across.""And what was the question?""It was, 'What happened after that?'"It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedyparoquet which belonged to a lady boarder:--"How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter justlike a person!"It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was oncepicked up a confession which had been written out in advance, in orderthat she might not forget it, by a sinner of seven years:--"Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious."Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress."Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen."It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth sixyears of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to byblue eyes aged four and five years:--"There were three little cocks who owned a country where there werea great many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in theirpockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in theirplaythings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal offorest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks."And this other poem:--"There came a blow with a stick."It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat."It was not good for her; it hurt her."Then a lady put Punchinello in prison."It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the conventwas bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet and heart-breakingsaying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmuredin her corner:--"As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!"There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through thecorridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was Sister Agatha. Thebig big girls--those over ten years of age--called her Agathocles.The refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, whichreceived no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with thegarden, was dark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. Allthe places round about furnished their contingent of insects.Each of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils,a special and expressive name. There was Spider corner, Caterpillarcorner, Wood-louse corner, and Cricket corner.Cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was notso cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed tothe boarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarinto distinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these fournations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat atmeals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoralvisit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter theclass-room through which he was passing.He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, whostood near him:--"Who is that?""She is a spider, Monseigneur.""Bah! And that one yonder?""She is a cricket.""And that one?""She is a caterpillar.""Really! and yourself?""I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur."Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning ofthis century Ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places whereyoung girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. AtEcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament,a distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the"dais" and the "censors,"--the first who held the cords of the dais, andthe others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowersbelonged by right to the florists. Four "virgins" walked in advance. Onthe morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the questionput in the dormitory, "Who is a virgin?"Madame Campan used to quote this saying of a "little one" of sevenyears, to a "big girl" of sixteen, who took the head of the procession,while she, the little one, remained at the rear, "You are a virgin, butI am not."CHAPTER V--DISTRACTIONSAbove the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the whitePaternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing people straightto paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:--"Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which Godplaced in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found threeangels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the goodVirgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation.The good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the threeapostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt inwhich God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret's cross is writtenon my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weepingfor God, when she met M. Saint John. 'Monsieur Saint John, whence comeyou?' 'I come from Ave Salus.' 'You have not seen the good God; whereis he?' 'He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his handsnailed, a little cap of white thorns on his head.' Whoever shall saythis thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise atthe last."In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall undera triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finallydisappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, andwho are old women now.A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of thisrefectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on thegarden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formedtwo long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory.The walls were white, the tables were black; these two mourning colorsconstitute the only variety in convents. The meals were plain, andthe food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of meat andvegetables combined, or salt fish--such was their luxury. This meagrefare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, anexception. The children ate in silence, under the eye of the motherwhose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum againstthe rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to time. This silencewas seasoned with the lives of the saints, read aloud from a littlepulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot of the crucifix. Thereader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn. At regular distances,on the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls in which thepupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks, and into whichthey sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish; this waspunished. These bowls were called ronds d'eau. The child who broke thesilence "made a cross with her tongue." Where? On the ground. She lickedthe pavement. The dust, that end of all joys, was charged with thechastisement of those poor little rose-leaves which had been guilty ofchirping.There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except asa unique copy, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule ofSaint-Benoit. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. Nemoregulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit.The pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, and setto reading it with avidity, a reading which was often interrupted bythe fear of being caught, which caused them to close the volumeprecipitately.From the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderateamount of pleasure. The most "interesting thing" they found were someunintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabbyfruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity ofthe punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, theysometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot oran inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speechto a letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twentyyears ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de----one of the mostelegant women in Paris. I quote literally: "One hides one's pear orone's apple as best one may. When one goes up stairs to put the veil onthe bed before supper, one stuffs them under one's pillow and at nightone eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in thecloset." That was one of their greatest luxuries.Once--it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to theconvent--one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who wasconnected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would askfor a day's leave of absence--an enormity in so austere a community. Thewager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she woulddo it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front ofthe pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of hercompanions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, "Monseigneur, a day'sleave of absence." Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with theprettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quelen smiled and said,"What, my dear child, a day's leave of absence! Three days if you like.I grant you three days." The prioress could do nothing; the archbishophad spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect maybe imagined.This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that thelife of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance,did not make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves torecording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact,which, however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected byany thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention thefact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in thereader's mind.About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who wasnot a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed asMadame Albertine. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad,and that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history itwas said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a greatmarriage.This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and tolerablypretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she see? Therewas some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked, she neverspoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her nostrils werelivid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh. To touch herhand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange spectral grace.Wherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing herpass, said to another sister, "She passes for a dead woman." "Perhapsshe is one," replied the other.A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from theeternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallerycalled L'OEil de Boeuf. It was in this gallery, which had only acircular bay, an oeil de boeuf, that Madame Albertine listened to theoffices. She always occupied it alone because from this gallery, beingon the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priestcould be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit wasoccupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer ofFrance, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince deLeon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop ofBesancon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at thePetit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfectcalmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. Thatday, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, andsaid, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, "Ah! Auguste!"The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raisedhis eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. Abreath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an instantacross that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and the madwoman had become a corpse again.Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had theprivilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained inthat "Ah! Auguste!" what revelations! M. de Rohan's name really wasAuguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the veryhighest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank therewas of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord,and that there existed between them some connection, of relationship,perhaps, but a very close one in any case, since she knew his "petname."Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Serent, oftenvisited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue ofthe privilege Magnates mulieres, and caused great consternation in theboarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor younggirls trembled and dropped their eyes.Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object ofattention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made,while waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop ofParis. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate theoffices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of theyoung recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he hada sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and todistinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to bevery coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed ina roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificentmoire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in theworld. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years.Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there wasone year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was anevent, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recallit.It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute alwaysplayed the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,--"MyZetulbe, come reign o'er my soul,"--and it was heard two or threetimes a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocalmothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended inshowers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more orless in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she wasZetulbe. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the RueDroit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything,attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if onlyfor a second, of the "young man" who played that flute so deliciously,and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. Therewere some who made their escape by a back door, and ascended to thethird story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch aglimpse through the gaps. Impossible! One even went so far as to thrusther arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief. Twowere still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, and risked theirlives there, and succeeded at last in seeing "the young man." He was anold emigre gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing his flute inhis attic, in order to pass the time.CHAPTER VI--THE LITTLE CONVENTIn this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectlydistinct buildings,--the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, theBoarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what wascalled the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in whichlived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloistersdestroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and whitemedleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might becalled, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of harlequinconvent.When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiledwomen had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under thewings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a smallpension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It wasa singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule, Sometimes the pupilsof the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay thema visit; the result is, that all those young memories haveretained among other souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, MotherSainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun ofSainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancientconvent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of theeighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belongedlater to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor towear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe witha scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which sheexhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house ather death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, thereremains only a doll.In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtainedpermission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into theLittle Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d'Hautpoul andMarquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the convent except bythe formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose. The pupilscalled her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing alittle periodical publication called l'Intrepide, asked to be allowedto enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Ducd'Orleans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers wereall in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declaredthat she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached herfierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, sheentered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as areason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted.Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis wassuperstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably goodprofile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted inthe inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up hersilverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written withher own hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion,possessed the property of frightening away robbers:--               Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:[15]               Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;               Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;               Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.               Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether thetwo thieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas andGestas, or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded thepretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, ofa descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached tothese verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate theGreat Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment,was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, andthe Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazarettoentrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none of theinhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world.Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, andfolded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, aprolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar, tothe right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off bya curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in theshadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choiron the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and thenovices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of thePetit-Picpus assisting at divine service. That cavern, which was calledthe choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church waslighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services wheretheir rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presenceonly by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.CHAPTER VII--SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESSDuring the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of thePetit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion,was Mother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur,author of Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoit. She hadbeen re-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, short, thick,"singing like a cracked pot," says the letter which we have alreadyquoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in thewhole convent, and for that reason adored. She was learned, erudite,wise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with Latin,stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine monk thana Benedictine nun.The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almostblind.The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine;the treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of thenovices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation,the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one in theconvent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde (MademoiselleGauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother des Anges(Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of the Filles-Dieu,and in the convent du Tresor, between Gisors and Magny; MotherSaint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adelaide(Mademoiselle d'Auverney), Mother Misericorde (Mademoiselle deCifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion(Mademoiselle de la Miltiere, received at the age of sixty in defianceof the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle deLaudiniere), Mother Presentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who wasprioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-Celigne (sister of thesculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle deSuzon), who went mad.There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of threeand twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of theChevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who wascalled Mother Assumption.Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, wasfond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took acomplete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen yearsof age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she made singstanding, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from thesmallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in thenature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipe made ofangels.Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were SisterEuphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguerite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was inher dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.All these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe onlytowards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and thefood was choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavisheda thousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nunand addressed her, the nun never replied.This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the wholeconvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowedon inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it wasthe gardener's bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress,and which was audible throughout the house, indicated by its variedpeals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions ofmaterial life which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, incase of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each personand each thing had its own peal. The prioress had one and one, thesub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons, so that the pupilsnever said "to go to lessons," but "to go to six-five." Four-four wasMadame de Genlis's signal. It was very often heard. "C'est le diablea quatre,"--it's the very deuce--said the uncharitable. Tennine strokesannounced a great event. It was the opening of the door of seclusion,a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on itshinges in the presence of the archbishop.With the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man enteredthe convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others:one, the chaplain, the Abbe Banes, old and ugly, whom they werepermitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other thedrawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused afew lines, calls M. Anciot, and describes as a frightful old hunchback.It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.Such was this curious house.CHAPTER VIII--POST CORDA LAPIDESAfter having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitableto point out, in a few words, its material configuration. The readeralready has some idea of it.The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the wholeof the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the RuePolonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane,called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded thistrapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several buildingsand a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was ajuxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird's-eyeview, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on theground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragmentof the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the RuePolonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated facade whichfaced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked itsextremity. Towards the centre of this facade was a low, arched door,whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders wove their webs,and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays, and on rareoccasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was thepublic entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a squarehall which was used as the servants' hall, and which the nuns called thebuttery. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters, andthe novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory, backedup by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and thecorner of the closed lane Aumarais, was the school, which was notvisible from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden,which was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which causedthe walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. Thegarden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the summit ofa hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran, as fromthe peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twosin between the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if theenclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of the alleys wouldhave resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleys all endedin the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal length.They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tallpoplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle ofthe Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at theangle of the Aumarais lane. In front of the Little Convent was what wascalled the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard,all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prisonwalls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of theRue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he willbe able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of theBernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy househad been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of thefourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the "tennis-groundof the eleven thousand devils."All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear themare very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout Lane;the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Eglantiers, for God openedflowers before man cut stones.CHAPTER IX--A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPESince we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of thePetit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to opena window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one otherlittle digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic anduseful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbeyof Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. Shetalked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under LouisXVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very intimate.It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on everypretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,--that it was likea city, and that there were streets in the monastery.She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year,she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, shesaid to the priest, "Monseigneur Saint-Francois gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you, father." And theschool-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but undertheir veils; charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothersfrown.On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She saidthat in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as themousquetaires. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was theeighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, whichexisted before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a greatpersonage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traverseda town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to haranguehim and presented him with four silver gondolas into which theyhad poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet thisinscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion wine; on thethird, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine. These four legends expressthe four stages descended by the drunkard; the first, intoxication,which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the third, that whichdulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of whichshe thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this.She would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up, which herrule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired tocontemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed thecupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. Assoon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fondof talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence and the mosttenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of comment forall those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could thattreasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret?Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic?They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died,they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, andopened it. They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like someconsecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter representing little Lovesflitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes.The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures. One of thecharming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is resisting,fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but thedancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered by thecolic. This platter, which is very curious, and which had, possibly,the honor of furnishing Moliere with an idea, was still in existencein September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-a-brac merchant in theBoulevard Beaumarchais.This good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because,said she, the parlor is too gloomy.CHAPTER X--ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATIONHowever, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought toconvey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with thesame severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple,in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the blackshutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was asalon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in whitemuslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portraitof a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even thehead of a Turk.It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famouschestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest inFrance, and which bore the reputation among the good people of theeighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of therealm.As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictinesof the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those whodepended on Citeaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not veryancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 theholy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in twochurches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Greve, a rareand frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. thePrior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemnprocession of all his clergy, in which the Pope's Nuncio officiated.But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin,Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outragecommitted on "the most holy sacrament of the altar," though buttemporary, would not depart from these holy souls, and it seemed tothem that it could only be extenuated by a "Perpetual Adoration" in somefemale monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, madedonations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the HolySacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this piousend, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission forthis foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbeof Saint-Germain, "on condition that no woman could be received unlessshe contributed three hundred livres income, which amounts to sixthousand livres, to the principal." After the Abbe of Saint-Germain, theking accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, androyal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and theParliament.Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of theBenedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris.Their first convent was "a new building" in the Rue Cassette, out of thecontributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Chateauvieux.This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded withthe Benedictine nuns of Citeaux. It mounted back to the Abbe ofSaint-Germain des Pres, in the same manner that the ladies of the SacredHeart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charityto the general of the Lazarists.It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,whose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. hadauthorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus,to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of theHoly Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct none the less.CHAPTER XI--END OF THE PETIT-PICPUSAt the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpuswas in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like allthe religious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity'sneeds; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will betransformed, and from being hostile to social progress, it will becomefavorable to it.The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840,the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. Therewere no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, thelatter had taken their departure. Volaverunt.The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that italarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professednuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. Howmany are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign thatthe circle of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. Inproportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the serviceof each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing nearwhen there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear theheavy rule of Saint-Benoit. The burden is implacable, and remains thesame for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus theydie. At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris,two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. Thislatter can say, like Julia Alpinula: "Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti ettres." It is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up theeducation of girls.We have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house withoutentering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, andwhich are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, ofthe melancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into thiscommunity, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day. Itis the closed garden, hortus conclusus. We have spoken of this singularplace in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, as detail andrespect are compatible. We do not understand all, but we insult nothing.We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre, whowound up by anointing the executioner, and from the sneer of Voltaire,who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.An illogical act on Voltaire's part, we may remark, by the way; forVoltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and evenfor those who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifixrepresent? The assassinated sage.In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.People are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,while unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the humanheart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, buton condition that they are followed by reconstructions.In the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessaryto know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeitsof the past assume false names, and gladly call themselves the future.This spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own passport. Letus inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. The past has avisage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the visageand let us tear off the mask.As for convents, they present a complex problem,--a question ofcivilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which protectsthem.BOOK SEVENTH.--PARENTHESISCHAPTER I--THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEAThis book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.Man is the second.Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, ithas been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, which is commonto the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as well as tomodern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mahometanism, as well as toChristianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to theInfinite.This is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certainideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, ourrestrictions, and even our indignations, we must say that every time weencounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feelourselves overpowered with respect. There is, in the synagogue, in themosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate,and a sublime side, which we adore. What a contemplation for the mind,and what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon thehuman wall!CHAPTER II--THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACTFrom the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticismis condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs inits circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness wherecentres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the greatsocial community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart isto the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean theimpoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at thebeginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by thespiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover,when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of disorder,it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in itsperiod of purity, because it still continues to set the example.Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early educationof modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injuriousto its development. So far as institution and formation with relationto man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century,questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. Theleprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderfulnations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the other the splendor ofEurope for centuries; and, at the present day, these two illustriouspeoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to the healthy andvigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.The convent--the ancient female convent in particular, such as it stillpresents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria,in Spain--is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. Thecloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. TheCatholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the blackradiance of death.The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, inobscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague withshadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immensewhite crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, allnude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,--bloody;hideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, theirknee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh,crowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood dropsof rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamondsand rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep,their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated withprayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselvesseraphim. Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do theylove? No. Do they live? No. Their nerves have turned to bone; theirbones have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night. Their breathunder their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration ofdeath. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them.The immaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ancientmonasteries of Spain. Lairs of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins,ferocious places.Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was,above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orientabout it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and keptwatch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was theodalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreamsand possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descendedfrom the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty wallsguarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, fromall living distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. Thein pace replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into the sea inthe East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both quarters, womenwrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the last; herethe drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, haveadopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashiona strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, ofinvalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassingfacts and all gloomy questions. A matter for declamations, say theclever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer;Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven, declaimers.I know not who has recently discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer,that Nero was a victim, and that pity is decidedly due to "that poorHolofernes."Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they areobstinate. The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eightleagues distant from Brussels,--there are relics of the Middle Agesthere which are attainable for everybody,--at the Abbey of Villers, thehole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerlythe courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stonedungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They were in pace.Each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and agrated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of theriver, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Fourfeet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is alwayssoaked. The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed. Inone of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted tothe wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of four slabsof granite, too short for a person to lie down in, too low for him tostand upright in. A human being was put inside, with a coverlid of stoneon top. This exists. It can be seen. It can be touched. These in pace,these dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-holeon a level with the river's current, that box of stone closed with a lidof granite like a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man herewas a living being, that soil which is but mud, that vault hole, thoseoozing walls,--what declaimers!CHAPTER III--ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PASTMonasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists inThibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. Itsimply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourgeof Europe. Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience, theforced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right ofthe first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, theferocities of which we have just spoken, the in pace, the closed mouths,the walled-up brains, so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeonof eternal vows, the taking of the habit, the interment of living souls.Add individual tortures to national degradations, and, whoever youmay be, you will shudder before the frock and the veil,--those twowinding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points and incertain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spiritof the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, anda singular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishingthe civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions inperpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfumewhich should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish whichshould persist in being eaten, the persecution of the child's garmentwhich should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses whichshould return to embrace the living."Ingrates!" says the garment, "I protected you in inclement weather. Whywill you have nothing to do with me?" "I have just come from the deepsea," says the fish. "I have been a rose," says the perfume. "I haveloved you," says the corpse. "I have civilized you," says the convent.To this there is but one reply: "In former days."To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of thegovernment of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition,to regild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, torefurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handleson holy water brushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism andmilitarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplicationof parasites, to force the past on the present,--this seems strange.Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. These theorists,who are in other respects people of intelligence, have a very simpleprocess; they apply to the past a glazing which they call socialorder, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders, antiqueauthority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go aboutshouting, "Look! take this, honest people." This logic was known to theancients. The soothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black heifer overwith chalk, and said, "She is white, Bos cretatus."As for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, aboveall, provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being alive,we attack it, and we try to kill it.Superstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms allforms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails intheir smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war mustbe made on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the fatalitiesof humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms. It isdifficult to seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the earth.A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, isa college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very actof asceticism, in the very heart of the city of '89 and of 1830 andof 1848, Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinarytimes, in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish,one has only to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinarytimes.Let us fight.Let us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property oftruth is never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration?There is that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that whichit is simply necessary to elucidate and examine. What a force is kindlyand serious examination! Let us not apply a flame where only a light isrequired.So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a generalproposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe,in India as well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever sayscloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation isunhealthy, their fermentation infects people with fever, and etiolatesthem; their multiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot thinkwithout affright of those lands where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greekmonks, marabouts, talapoins, and dervishes multiply even like swarms ofvermin.This said, the religious question remains. This question has certainmysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted to look at itfixedly.CHAPTER IV--THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLESMen unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right?By virtue of the right of association.They shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue ofthe right which every man has to open or shut his door.They do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the rightto go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.There, at home, what do they do?They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renouncethe world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests.They are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of thempossesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, eachone who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives to all. Hewho was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal ofhim who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo thesame tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep onthe same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs, thesame rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go barefoot,all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince is thesame shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared.They bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality ofbaptismal names. They have dissolved the carnal family, and constitutedin their community a spiritual family. They have no other relatives thanall men. They succor the poor, they care for the sick. They elect thosewhom they obey. They call each other "my brother."You stop me and exclaim, "But that is the ideal convent!"It is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I should takenotice of it.Thence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken of aconvent with respectful accents. The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia castaside, the historical and political question held in reserve, from thepurely philosophical point of view, outside the requirements of militantpolicy, on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntarymatter and shall contain only consenting parties, I shall alwaysconsider a cloistered community with a certain attentive, and, in somerespects, a deferential gravity.Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is acommune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula:Equality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! And what a splendidtransfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into arepublic.Let us continue.But these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. Theydress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call eachother brothers, that is well; but they do something else?Yes.What?They gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.What does this signify?CHAPTER V--PRAYERThey pray.To whom?To God.To pray to God,--what is the meaning of these words?Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent,permanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because,if it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, sinceit is infinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would endthere? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we canattribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is itnot the absolute, of which we are only the relative?At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there notan infinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarmingplural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this secondinfinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter'smirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with anotherabyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? Does it think? Doesit love? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each ofthem has a will principle, and there is an _I_ in the upper infinity asthere is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ below is the soul; the_I_ on high is God.To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought,with the infinity on high, is called praying.Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We mustreform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towardsthe Unknown; thought, revery, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. Whatis conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, revery,prayer,--these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them.Whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow;that is to say, to the light.The grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing ofhumanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, thereexists the right of the soul.To crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Letus not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree ofcreation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. Wehave a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery againstthe miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd,to admit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purifybelief, to remove superstitions from above religion; to clear God ofcaterpillars.CHAPTER VI--THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYERWith regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they aresincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There isalso a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; thisphilosophy is called blindness.To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blindman's self-sufficiency.The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs whichthis groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholdsGod. One fancies he hears a mole crying, "I pity them with their sun!"There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, ledback to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure thatthey are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and inany case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they proveGod.We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing theirphilosophy.Let us go on.The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in payingthemselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North,impregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked arevolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with theword Will.To say: "the plant wills," instead of: "the plant grows": this would befecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: "the universe wills." Why?Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an _I_;the universe wills, therefore it has a God.As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, rejectnothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, appearsto us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it.To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible onany other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstratedthis.The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everythingbecomes "a mental conception."With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubtsthe existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it existsitself.From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only"a mental conception."Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in thelump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes allend in the monosyllable, No.To No there is only one reply, Yes.Nihilism has no point.There is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everythingis something. Nothing is nothing.Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.Even to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be anenergy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the conditionof man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; inother words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the manof felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should bea cordial. To enjoy,--what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! Thebrute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all asan elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternizein them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such isthe function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths.Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It isnecessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable tothe human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this!It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of scienceand becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying, and thatphilosophy herself is promoted to religion.Philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon itat its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient tocuriosity.For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to anotheroccasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understandman as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without those twoforces which are their two motors: faith and love.Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.What is this ideal? It is God.Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.CHAPTER VII--PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAMEHistory and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time,simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver,Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct,and limpid, and offers no obscurity.But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and itsabuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is ahuman problem.When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence,of aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of torturebut of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no.A convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto,sacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supremeabnegation.To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device ofmonasticism.In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill ofexchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light.In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible.All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. Weunderstand wrath, but not malice.CHAPTER VIII--FAITH, LAWA few words more.We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise thespiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honorthe thoughtful man.We salute the man who kneels.A faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.One is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible laborand invisible labor.To contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.Folded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.Thales remained motionless for four years. He founded philosophy.In our opinion, cenobites are not lazy men, and recluses are not idlers.To meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.Without invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe thata perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point,the priest and the philosopher agree. We must die. The Abbe de la Trappereplies to Horace.To mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre,--this isthe law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect,the ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; weadmit it. There is a moral grandeur; we hold to that. Thoughtless andvivacious spirits say:--"What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery?What purpose do they serve? What do they do?"Alas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and whichawaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make ofus, we reply: "There is probably no work more divine than that performedby these souls." And we add: "There is probably no work which is moreuseful."There certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who neverpray at all.In our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that ismingled with prayer.Leibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. Deo erexitVoltaire.We are for religion as against religions.We are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and thesublimity of prayer.Moreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,--a minute whichwill not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,--atthis hour, when so many men have low brows and souls but littleelevated, among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment,and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter,whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.The monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is stillsacrifice. To mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of itsown.Taken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on allsides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery,the female convent in particular,--for in our century it is woman whosuffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is somethingof protestation,--the female convent has incontestably a certainmajesty.This cloistered existence which is so austere, so depressing, a few ofwhose features we have just traced, is not life, for it is not liberty;it is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange placewhence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one sidethe abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; itis the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminatedand obscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which hasbecome enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the halfobscurity of the tomb.We, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them,live by faith,--we have never been able to think without a sort oftender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full ofenvy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of thesehumble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of themystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which isnot yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessingthe sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiringtowards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on thedarkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, attimes, by the deep breaths of eternity.BOOK EIGHTH.--CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEMCHAPTER I--WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENTIt was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressedit, "fallen from the sky."He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the RuePolonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middleof the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he hadcaught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he hadseen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation;that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was thegardener's bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we havealready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before agood, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied byCosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: "I must remain herehenceforth." This remark trotted through Fauchelevent's head all nightlong.To tell the truth, neither of them slept.Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was onhis scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned toParis. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had strandedhim in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,--toremain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, thisconvent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the mostdangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one stepintervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if hecould manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who wouldever seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place wassafety.On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began bydeclaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How hadM. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloisterwalls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? Onecannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one's arms. Who wasthat child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had livedin the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothingof what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air whichdiscouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: "Onedoes not question a saint." M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestigein Fauchelevent's eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had letfall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleinehad probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he waspursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised himself in somepolitical affair, and was in hiding; which last did not displeaseFauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had anold fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine hadselected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he shouldwish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Faucheleventreturned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M.Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl withhim. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still didnot believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entranceinto Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, andcould see nothing clearly but this: "M. Madeleine saved my life."This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said tohimself: "It is my turn now." He added in his conscience: "M. Madeleinedid not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himselfunder the cart for the purpose of dragging me out." He made up his mindto save M. Madeleine.Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself diversreplies: "After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief?Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same.Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same."But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimericalundertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladderthan his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that oldrustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generousenterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and thesteep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent wasan old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the endof his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world,found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to beperformed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when heis dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which hehad never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add,that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent haddestroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a goodaction of some kind absolutely necessary to him.So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That descriptionis just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have nowreached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's physiology becomes useful.He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to hiscunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through variouscauses, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of acarter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horsesseem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He hadsome natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rarething in a village; and the other peasants said of him: "He talks almostlike a gentleman with a hat." Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to thatspecies, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the lastcentury qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphorsshowered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in thepigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather citified; pepper andsalt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate,worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, animpulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a preciousquality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and hisvices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomywas of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had noneof those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signifymalice or stupidity.At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done anenormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his trussof straw, and watching Cosette's slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up andsaid:--"Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?"This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from hisrevery.The two men took counsel together."In the first place," said Fauchelevent, "you will begin by not settingfoot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in thegarden and we are done for.""That is true.""Monsieur Madeleine," resumed Fauchelevent, "you have arrived at a veryauspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one ofthe ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in ourdirection. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hoursare being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them.The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we areall saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say'our cell,' and that I say 'my cabin.' The prayers for the dying are tobe said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace herefor to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.""Still," observed Jean Valjean, "this cottage is in the niche of thewall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visiblefrom the convent.""And I add that the nuns never come near it.""Well?" said Jean Valjean.The interrogation mark which accentuated this "well" signified:"it seems to me that one may remain concealed here?" It was to thisinterrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:--"There are the little girls.""What little girls?" asked Jean Valjean.Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he haduttered, a bell emitted one stroke."The nun is dead," said he. "There is the knell."And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.The bell struck a second time."It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strikeonce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from thechurch.--You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have aball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, tohunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.""Who?" asked Jean Valjean."The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They wouldshriek: 'Oh! a man!' There is no danger to-day. There will be norecreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hearthe bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.""I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils."And Jean Valjean thought to himself:--"Here is Cosette's education already provided."Fauchelevent exclaimed:--"Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you!And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You seehow they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast."Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.--"This conventwould be our salvation," he murmured.Then he raised his voice:--"Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.""No," said Fauchelevent, "the difficulty is to get out."Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart."To get out!""Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessaryto get out."And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,Fauchelevent went on:--"You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me,you fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one toenter by the door."All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell."Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "they are ringing up the vocal mothers. Theyare going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies.She died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannotyou get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for thesake of questioning you, but how did you get in?"Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again intothat terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forestfilled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel thatshall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself thewhole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents onthe watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards hiscollar, Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps."Impossible!" said he. "Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from thesky.""But I believe it, I believe it," retorted Fauchelevent. "You have noneed to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand forthe purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then droppedyou. Only, he meant to place you in a man's convent; he made a mistake.Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go andinform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view acorpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are notat all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe inanything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. Howquickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter?Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?""Cosette.""She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?""Yes.""It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my servicedoor which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I havemy vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. FatherFauchelevent goes out with his basket--that is perfectly natural. Youwill tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. Iwill leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, afruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and whohas a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller's ear, that she is aniece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Thenthe little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have youre-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?"Jean Valjean shook his head."No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent.Find some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, likeCosette."Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of hisleft hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.A third peal created a diversion."That is the dead-doctor taking his departure," said Fauchelevent. "Hehas taken a look and said: 'She is dead, that is well.' When the doctorhas signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker's company sends acoffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister,the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a partof my gardener's duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She isplaced in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street,and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don'tcount the undertaker's men and myself as men. It is in that hall that Inail up the coffin. The undertaker's men come and get it, and whipup, coachman! that's the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box withnothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That's whata burial is like. De profundis."A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleepingCosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of anangel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her.He was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. Thegood old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:--"The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they aregoing to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemeterywhich is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which isgoing to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friendthere, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess oneprivilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There isa special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how manyevents have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, andFather Madeleine--""Is buried," said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.Fauchelevent caught the word."Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial."A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belledknee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again."This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I ampricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don'tstir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you arehungry, there is wine, bread and cheese."And he hastened out of the hut, crying: "Coming! coming!"Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as hiscrooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on hismelon patch.Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put thenuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voicereplied: "Forever! Forever!" that is to say: "Enter."The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing thegardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. Theprioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting forFauchelevent.CHAPTER II--FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTYIt is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions,notably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on criticaloccasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form ofpreoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who wasthat wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, whowas ordinarily cheerful.The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. Theprioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:--"Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent."This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.Fauchelevent bowed again."Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.""Here I am, reverend Mother.""I have something to say to you.""And so have I," said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused himinward terror, "I have something to say to the very reverend Mother."The prioress stared at him."Ah! you have a communication to make to me.""A request.""Very well, speak."Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category ofpeasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes aforce; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Faucheleventhad been a success during the something more than two years which he hadpassed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening,he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was at adistance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw beforehim only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and sharpnesshe had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh, and thosecorpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose sight growskeener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute. He hadapplied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals,and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloisterpossessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in hisear. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all; that constituted his art.The whole convent thought him stupid. A great merit in religion. Thevocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. Heinspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and never went out exceptfor well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden.This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. None the less, hehad set two men to chattering: the porter, in the convent, and heknew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, atthe cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of theirsepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject ofthese nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death. But hedid not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought a great deal ofhim. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into thebargain,--what qualities! They would have found it difficult to replacehim.The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he isappreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangueto the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, hisinfirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth,of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden,of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he hadbeen obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon,and he wound up as follows: "That he had a brother"--(the prioress madea movement),--"a brother no longer young"--(a second movement on thepart of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),--"that, if hemight be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and helphim, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receivefrom him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if hisbrother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health wasbroken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged,greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a littledaughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God inthe house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day."When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of herrosary between her fingers, and said to him:--"Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?""For what purpose?""To serve as a lever.""Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent.The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoiningroom, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal motherswere probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.CHAPTER III--MOTHER INNOCENTEAbout a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seatedherself once more on her chair.The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographicreport of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability."Father Fauvent!""Reverend Mother!""Do you know the chapel?""I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.""And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?""Two or three times.""There is a stone to be raised.""Heavy?""The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.""The slab which closes the vault?""Yes.""It would be a good thing to have two men for it.""Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.""A woman is never a man.""We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can.Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles ofSaint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred andsixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius.""Neither do I.""Merit consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister isnot a dock-yard.""And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!""And can you get a lever?""That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.""There is a ring in the stone.""I will put the lever through it.""And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.""That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.""And the four Mother Precentors will help you.""And when the vault is open?""It must be closed again.""Will that be all?""No.""Give me your orders, very reverend Mother.""Fauvent, we have confidence in you.""I am here to do anything you wish.""And to hold your peace about everything!""Yes, reverend Mother.""When the vault is open--""I will close it again.""But before that--""What, reverend Mother?""Something must be lowered into it."A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip whichresembled hesitation, broke it."Father Fauvent!""Reverend Mother!""You know that a mother died this morning?""No.""Did you not hear the bell?""Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.""Really?""I can hardly distinguish my own signal.""She died at daybreak.""And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning.""It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman."The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, andresumed:--"Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox,merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.""Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.""The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on thechurch.""I know.""No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. Afine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!""More often!""Hey?""More often!""What do you say?""I say more often.""More often than what?""Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said moreoften.""I don't understand you. Why do you say more often?""In order to speak like you, reverend Mother.""But I did not say 'more often.'"At that moment, nine o'clock struck."At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored bethe most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress."Amen," said Fauchelevent.The clock struck opportunely. It cut "more often" short. It is probable,that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would neverhave unravelled that skein.Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred,then raised her voice:--"In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, shewill perform miracles.""She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and strivingnot to flinch again."Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion.No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal deBerulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls toGod, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But withoutattaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's death was veryprecious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her lastcommands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have beenin her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it.She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There wassomething of paradise in that death."Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing."Amen," said he."Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done."The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent heldhis peace.She went on:--"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in OurLord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, andwho bear wonderful fruit.""Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in thegarden.""Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.""Like yourself, reverend Mother.""She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of ourHoly Father, Pius VII.--""The one who crowned the Emp--Buonaparte."For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one.Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, didnot hear it. She continued:--"Father Fauvent?""Reverend Mother?""Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single wordmight be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, a worm of theearth; this was done. Is this true?""Yes, reverend Mother.""The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath thegallows; this was done.""That is true.""Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber emptiesinto the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved thesign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope thatpassers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must beobeyed.""So be it.""The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was,as he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to thechurch of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis wasBishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?""For that matter, no, reverend Mother.""The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse."Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. Theprioress resumed:--"Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin inwhich she has slept for the last twenty years.""That is just.""It is a continuation of her slumber.""So I shall have to nail up that coffin?""Yes.""And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?""Precisely.""I am at the orders of the very reverend community.""The four Mother Precentors will assist you.""In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.""No. In lowering the coffin.""Where?""Into the vault.""What vault?""Under the altar."Fauchelevent started."The vault under the altar?""Under the altar.""But--""You will have an iron bar.""Yes, but--""You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.""But--""The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar ofthe chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death whereshe prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion.She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.""But it is forbidden.""Forbidden by men, enjoined by God.""What if it became known?""We have confidence in you.""Oh! I am a stone in your walls.""The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consultedagain, and who are now deliberating, have decided that MotherCrucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin,under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracleshere! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue fromtombs.""But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission--""Saint Benoit II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted ConstantinePogonatus.""But the commissary of police--""Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gaulsunder the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nunsto be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.""But the inspector from the Prefecture--""The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventhgeneral of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: Stat crux dumvolvitur orbis.""Amen," said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in thismanner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. Onthe day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing inhis body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, hehalted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it andmade very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usuallysubjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull,rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:--"I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? Thefirst abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that isblest because it gave him birth. His father was named Tecelin, and hismother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordainedabbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume de Champeaux; he hadseven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; heoverthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruysand Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who werecalled the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, dartedlightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated thecouncil of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea,Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile, arrangedthe disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised PopeEugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performedtwo hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime, and as manyas thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoit? He was the patriarch ofMont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale,he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, twohundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, fourthousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-sixkings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints,and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side SaintBernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one sideSaint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state,the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, theadministration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chancepasser-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. Wehave not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitarydepartment is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to thecommissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!"Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioresscontinued:--"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanaticsand those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. Wedo not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that whichwe should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there existpeople who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard andthe Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain goodecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are soblasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross ofJesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! Thereis no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but notthe name of Cesar de Bus. Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessedmemory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop,the Cardinal de Perigord, did not even know that Charles deGondren succeeded to Berulle, and Francois Bourgoin to Gondren,and Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe toJean-Francois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not becausehe was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, butbecause he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the materialfor an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois deSales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why?Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap,was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of themfollowed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does thatprevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloakto a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to thetruth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts whichare blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked peopleare! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution.One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holydeath is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. SaintLeo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other tothe king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting,in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and thesupremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, held his ownin this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracyagreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even onmatters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, wascouncillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do whatwe please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself inFrance, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, althoughhe died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the monthof March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhorpsalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detestyet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only toread Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Lucd'Achery."The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent."Is it settled, Father Fauvent?""It is settled, reverend Mother.""We may depend on you?""I will obey.""That is well.""I am entirely devoted to the convent.""That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carryit to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then weshall return to the cloister. Between eleven o'clock and midnight, youwill come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profoundsecrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors,Mother Ascension and yourself.""And the sister at the post?""She will not turn round.""But she will hear.""She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learnsnot."A pause ensued. The prioress went on:--"You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at thepost should perceive your presence.""Reverend Mother?""What, Father Fauvent?""Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?""He will pay it at four o'clock to-day. The peal which orders thedoctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do notunderstand any of the peals?""I pay no attention to any but my own.""That is well, Father Fauvent.""Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required.""Where will you obtain it?""Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have myheap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.""About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget.""Reverend Mother?""What?""If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is thestrong man for you. A perfect Turk!""You will do it as speedily as possible.""I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require anassistant. I limp.""To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry II.,who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII., has twosurnames, the Saint and the Lame.""Two surtouts are a good thing," murmured Fauchelevent, who really was alittle hard of hearing."Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it.That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar,at eleven o'clock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must havebeen completed a good quarter of an hour before that.""I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are myorders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o'clock exactly, I am tobe in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascensionwill be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shallhave my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, andwe will close the vault again. After which, there will be no traceof anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has beenarranged, reverend Mother?""No!""What else remains?""The empty coffin remains."This produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated."What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?""It will be given to the earth.""Empty?"Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of agesture which dismisses a troublesome subject."Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in thebasement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and Iwill cover the coffin with the pall.""Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower itinto the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it.""Ah! the de--!" exclaimed Fauchelevent.The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly atthe gardener. The vil stuck fast in his throat.He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath."I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce theeffect of a corpse.""You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will managethe empty coffin?""I will make that my special business."The prioress's face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew sereneonce more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior tohim. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point ofpassing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:--"I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to meto-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter."CHAPTER IV--IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READAUSTIN CASTILLEJOThe strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man;they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Faucheleventwas in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to hiscottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed hernear the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean waspointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall, and saying to her,"Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away from thishouse, but we shall return to it, and we shall be very happy here. Thegood man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that.You will wait for me at a lady's house. I shall come to fetch you. Obey,and say nothing, above all things, unless you want Madame Thenardier toget you again!"Cosette nodded gravely.Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening thedoor."Well?""Everything is arranged, and nothing is," said Fauchelevent. "I havepermission to bring you in; but before bringing you in you must begot out. That's where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with thechild.""You will carry her out?""And she will hold her tongue?""I answer for that.""But you, Father Madeleine?"And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:--"Why, get out as you came in!"Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,"Impossible."Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:--"There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would putearth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of thecorpse will not seem like the real thing, it won't do, it will getdisplaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. You understand,Father Madeleine, the government will notice it."Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he wasraving.Fauchelevent went on:--"How the de--uce are you going to get out? It must all be done byto-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. Theprioress expects you."Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for aservice which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That itfell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed upthe coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nunwho had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin whichhad served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar ofthe chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she wasone of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and thevocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it wasso much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nailup the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower thecorpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was toadmit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a pupil.That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. Thatthe prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening,after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could notbring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside.That that was the first problem. And then, that there was another: theempty coffin."What is that empty coffin?" asked Jean Valjean.Fauchelevent replied:--"The coffin of the administration.""What coffin? What administration?""A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, 'A nun has died.'The government sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse andundertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. Theundertaker's men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing init.""Put something in it.""A corpse? I have none.""No.""What then?""A living person.""What person?""Me!" said Jean Valjean.Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst underhis chair."You!""Why not?"Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up hisface like a flash from heaven in the winter."You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: 'Mother Crucifixion isdead.' and I add: 'and Father Madeleine is buried.'""Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.""Very seriously, I must get out of this place.""Certainly.""l have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.""Well?""The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.""In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried inwhite.""Let it be a white cloth, then.""You are not like other men, Father Madeleine."To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage anddaring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable thingswhich surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the "petty courseof life in the convent," caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as agull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in apasser-by.Jean Valjean went on:--"The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offersthe means. But give me some information, in the first place. How is itmanaged? Where is this coffin?""The empty one?""Yes.""Down stairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on twotrestles, under the pall.""How long is the coffin?""Six feet.""What is this dead-room?""It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window openingon the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and twodoors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church.""What church?""The church in the street, the church which any one can enter.""Have you the keys to those two doors?""No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; theporter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.""When does the porter open that door?""Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come to get thecoffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.""Who nails up the coffin?""I do.""Who spreads the pall over it?""I do.""Are you alone?""Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room.That is even written on the wall.""Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?""No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on thedead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which I havethe key.""At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?""About three o'clock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at theVaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. It is not very near.""I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all themorning. And how about food? I shall be hungry.""I will bring you something.""You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock."Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints."But that is impossible!""Bah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?"What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simplematter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits thanthis. Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contracthimself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject toflight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.An escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of acure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a baleof goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there isnone, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle withoutdying--this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents.Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,--that convict'sexpedient,--is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monkAustin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yustein this manner.Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:--"But how will you manage to breathe?""I will breathe.""In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.""You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here andthere, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.""Good! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?""A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze."And Jean Valjean added:--"Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either becaught here, or accept this escape through the hearse."Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and loungingbetween the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has notsaid to a cat, "Do come in!" There are men who, when an incident standshalf-open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecisionbetween two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through theabrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as theyare, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger thanthe audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. ButJean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself. Hegrumbled:--"Well, since there is no other means."Jean Valjean resumed:--"The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at thecemetery.""That is the very point that is not troublesome," exclaimedFauchelevent. "If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, Iam sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard,and a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the oldschool. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put thegrave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. Theywill arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before thegates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive directly up tothe grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall have a hammer,a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, theundertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. Thepriest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holywater, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne.He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, he willeither be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not drunk, I shallsay to him: 'Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing [the Good Quince]is open.' I carry him off, I get him drunk,--it does not take long tomake Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it abouthim,--I lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get intothe cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longerany one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: 'Beoff; I will do your work for you.' Off he goes, and I drag you out ofthe hole."Jean Valjean held out his hand, and Fauchelevent precipitated himselfupon it with the touching effusion of a peasant."That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.""Provided nothing goes wrong," thought Fauchelevent. "In that case, itwould be terrible."CHAPTER V--IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTALOn the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-byon the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashionedhearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears. This hearsecontained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a largeblack cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, inwhich could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his redcap, followed. Two undertaker's men in gray uniforms trimmed with blackwalked on the right and the left of the hearse. Behind it came an oldman in the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The procession wasgoing in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennae ofa pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket.The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries ofParis. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriageentrance and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clungtenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavaliere and theporte pietonne.[16] The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpushad obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be buried therein a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having formerlybelonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus bound toservice in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in thiscemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of theParis cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being amunicipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like therest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous gratedgates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, andinhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore,swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappearedbehind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were delayedafter that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him toget out--his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of publicfunerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's window.The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard itfall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not hiscard, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed andasleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate withhis key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteenfrancs.This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations,embarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppresseda little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called theEastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shopnext to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince paintedon a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers' tables,and the other on the tombs, with this sign: Au Bon Coing.The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. Itwas falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers weredeserting it. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried inthe Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Pere-Lachaise if you please! to beburied in Pere-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany.It is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerableenclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight alleys,box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, andvery tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. There were verylugubrious lines about it.The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and theblack cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame manwho followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, theexit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,--allhad been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion underthe altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. Itis one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it,not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their ownconsciences. In the cloister, what is called the "government" is onlyan intermeddling with authority, an interference which is alwaysquestionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shallsee. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves.The tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tributeto God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frameof mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent,the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, toall appearance. Jean Valjean's composure was one of those powerfultranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer feltdoubtful as to his success.What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years,he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk atleast ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he likedwith him. He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne's headadjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will. Fauchelevent'sconfidence was perfect.At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to thecemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said halfaloud, as he rubbed his big hands:--"Here's a fine farce!"All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permissionfor interment must be exhibited. The undertaker's man addressed himselfto the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always isproductive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger,came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He wasa sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets andcarried a mattock under his arm.Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger."Who are you?" he demanded."The man replied:--"The grave-digger."If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, hewould make the same face that Fauchelevent made."The grave-digger?""Yes.""You?""I.""Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.""He was.""What! He was?""He is dead."Fauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger coulddie. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. Bydint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one's own.Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly thestrength to stammer:--"But it is not possible!""It is so.""But," he persisted feebly, "Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.""After Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my nameis Gribier."Fauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of anunsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.Fauchelevent burst out laughing."Ah!" said he, "what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead,but long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoiris? He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surene, morbigou! of realParis Surene? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he wasa jolly fellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not, comrade?We'll go and have a drink together presently."The man replied:--"I have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. I never drink."The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of thecemetery.Fauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety thanfrom infirmity.The grave-digger walked on in front of him.Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, andwho, though slender, are extremely strong."Comrade!" cried Fauchelevent.The man turned round."I am the convent grave-digger.""My colleague," said the man.Fauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that hehad to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. Hemuttered:"So Father Mestienne is dead."The man replied:--"Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when thetime is up. It was Father Mestienne's turn. Father Mestienne died."Fauchelevent repeated mechanically: "The good God--""The good God," said the man authoritatively. "According to thephilosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the SupremeBeing.""Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?" stammered Fauchelevent."It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.""People do not know each other until they have drunk together. He whoempties his glass empties his heart. You must come and have a drink withme. Such a thing cannot be refused.""Business first."Fauchelevent thought: "I am lost."They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alleyleading to the nuns' corner.The grave-digger resumed:--"Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must eat,I cannot drink."And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning aphrase well:--"Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst."The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged intoa thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place ofsepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain thehearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winterrains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.He approached the grave-digger."They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine," murmured Fauchelevent."Villager," retorted the man, "I ought not be a grave-digger. Myfather was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me forliterature. But he had reverses. He had losses on 'change. I was obligedto renounce the profession of author. But I am still a public writer.""So you are not a grave-digger, then?" returned Fauchelevent, clutchingat this branch, feeble as it was."The one does not hinder the other. I cumulate."Fauchelevent did not understand this last word."Come have a drink," said he.Here a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish,offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was topay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An offerof a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by thenew grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but the oldgardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais inthe dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself, Fauchelevent didnot wish to pay, troubled as he was.The grave-digger went on with a superior smile:--"One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne's reversion. One gets tobe a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the laborof the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener's stall inthe market of the Rue de Sevres. You know? the Umbrella Market. All thecooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their declarations oflove to the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love letters; in theevening I dig graves. Such is life, rustic."The hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree,was gazing about him on all sides. Great drops of perspiration trickleddown from his brow."But," continued the grave-digger, "a man cannot serve two mistresses.I must choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining myhand."The hearse halted.The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on apile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible."What a farce this is!" repeated Fauchelevent in consternation.CHAPTER VI--BETWEEN FOUR PLANKSWho was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and hecould almost breathe.It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience conferssecurity of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean hadbeen progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day.He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubtas to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never morecomplete composure.The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. Itseemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into JeanValjean's tranquillity.From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he hadfollowed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing withdeath.Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, JeanValjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from thediminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached theearth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossingthe bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that theywere entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:--"Here is the grave."Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating againstthe planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was beingfastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.Then he experienced a giddiness.The undertaker's man and the grave-digger had probably allowed thecoffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. Herecovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless.He had just touched the bottom.He had a certain sensation of cold.A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, whichhe did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able tocatch them one by one:--"Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam aeternam, etalii in approbrium, ut videant semper."A child's voice said:--"De profundis."The grave voice began again:--"Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine."The child's voice responded:--"Et lux perpetua luceat ei."He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain onthe plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water.He thought: "This will be over soon now. Patience for a little whilelonger. The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will takeMestienne off to drink. I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will returnalone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour."The grave voice resumed"Requiescat in pace."And the child's voice said:--"Amen."Jean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreatingfootsteps."There, they are going now," thought he. "I am alone."All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be aclap of thunder.It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.A second shovelful fell.One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.A third shovelful of earth fell.Then a fourth.There are things which are too strong for the strongest man. JeanValjean lost consciousness.CHAPTER VII--IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON'T LOSETHE CARDThis is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean.When the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy hadentered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, whohad not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend overand grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.Then Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve.He placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed hisarms and said:--"I am the one to pay!"The grave-digger stared at him in amazement, and replied:--"What's that, peasant?"Fauchelevent repeated:--"I am the one who pays!""What?""For the wine.""What wine?""That Argenteuil wine.""Where is the Argenteuil?""At the Bon Coing.""Go to the devil!" said the grave-digger.And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.The coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself staggerand on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shoutedin a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began tomingle:--"Comrade! Before the Bon Coing is shut!"The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Faucheleventcontinued."I will pay."And he seized the man's arm."Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have cometo help you. It is a business which can be performed at night. Let usbegin, then, by going for a drink."And as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this melancholyreflection occurred to him: "And if he drinks, will he get drunk?""Provincial," said the man, "if you positively insist upon it, Iconsent. We will drink. After work, never before."And he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back."It is Argenteuil wine, at six.""Oh, come," said the grave-digger, "you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong,ding dong, that's all you know how to say. Go hang yourself."And he threw in a second shovelful.Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he wassaying."Come along and drink," he cried, "since it is I who pays the bill.""When we have put the child to bed," said the grave-digger.He flung in a third shovelful.Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:--"It's cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after usif we were to plant her there without a coverlet."At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent's wild gaze fellmechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still lightenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom ofthat yawning pocket.The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain,traversed Fauchelevent's pupils. An idea had just occurred to him.He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without thegrave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth,observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom ofit.The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly athim and said:--"By the way, you new man, have you your card?"The grave-digger paused."What card?""The sun is on the point of setting.""That's good, it is going to put on its nightcap.""The gate of the cemetery will close immediately.""Well, what then?""Have you your card?""Ah! my card?" said the grave-digger.And he fumbled in his pocket.Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passedon to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second."Why, no," said he, "I have not my card. I must have forgotten it.""Fifteen francs fine," said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people."Ah! Jesus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-a-bas-la-lune!"[17] he exclaimed. "Fifteenfrancs fine!""Three pieces of a hundred sous," said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger dropped his shovel.Fauchelevent's turn had come."Ah, come now, conscript," said Fauchelevent, "none of this despair.There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.Fifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able topay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes andthe devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear,the sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, thecemetery will be closed in five minutes more.""That is true," replied the man."Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it isas hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season topass it before it is shut.""That is true.""In that case, a fine of fifteen francs.""Fifteen francs.""But you have time. Where do you live?""A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. No.87 Rue de Vaugirard.""You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your bestspeed.""That is exactly so.""Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,the cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will benothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. I'll watch it for you inthe meantime, so that it shall not run away.""I am indebted to you for my life, peasant.""Decamp!" said Fauchelevent.The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set offon a run.When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened untilhe heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over thegrave, and said in a low tone:--"Father Madeleine!"There was no reply.Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbedinto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:--"Are you there?"Silence in the coffin.Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized hiscold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.Jean Valjean's face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyeswere closed.Fauchelevent's hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet,then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on thecoffin. He stared at Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:--"He is dead!"And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence thathis clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:--"And this is the way I save his life!"Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it isan error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotionoften talks aloud."It is Father Mestienne's fault. Why did that fool die? What need wasthere for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one wasexpecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine!He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there anysense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his littlegirl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The ideaof its being possible for a man like that to die like this! When I thinkhow he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn't believe me. Well!Here's a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very bestman out of all the good God's good folks! And his little girl! Ah! Inthe first place, I won't go back there myself. I shall stay here. Afterhaving done such a thing as that! What's the use of being two old men,if we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he manage toenter the convent? That was the beginning of it all. One should notdo such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He does not hear me.Now get out of this scrape if you can!"And he tore his hair.A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It wasthe cemetery gate closing.Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back andrecoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.Jean Valjean's eyes were open and gazing at him.To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as muchso. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by allthese excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with aliving man or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing athim.[Illustration: The Resurrection 2b8-7-resurrection]"I fell asleep," said Jean Valjean.And he raised himself to a sitting posture.Fauchelevent fell on his knees."Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!"Then he sprang to his feet and cried:--"Thanks, Father Madeleine!"Jean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficultyin recovering himself as Jean Valjean had."So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much thatyou came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: 'Good! there he is,stifled,' I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket.They would have put me in Bicetre. What do you suppose I shouldhave done if you had been dead? And your little girl? There's thatfruit-seller,--she would never have understood it! The child is thrustinto your arms, and then--the grandfather is dead! What a story! goodsaints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that's the best ofit!""I am cold," said Jean Valjean.This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there waspressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even whenthey had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it,and there was about them something uncanny, which was the sinisterbewilderment inspired by the place."Let us get out of here quickly," exclaimed Fauchelevent.He fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he hadprovided himself."But first, take a drop," said he.The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swalloweda mouthful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.He got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lidagain.Three minutes later they were out of the grave.Moreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. Thecemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not tobe apprehended. That "conscript" was at home busily engaged in lookingfor his card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings,since it was in Fauchelevent's pocket. Without a card, he could not getback into the cemetery.Fauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, andtogether they buried the empty coffin.When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:--"Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock."Night was falling.Jean Valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking. Hehad stiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like acorpse. The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those fourplanks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb."You are benumbed," said Fauchelevent. "It is a pity that I have a gameleg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.""Bah!" replied Jean Valjean, "four paces will put life into my legs oncemore."They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. Onarriving before the closed gate and the porter's pavilion Fauchelevent,who held the grave-digger's card in his hand, dropped it into the box,the porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out."How well everything is going!" said Fauchelevent; "what a capital ideathat was of yours, Father Madeleine!"They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world.In the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to twopassports.The Rue Vaugirard was deserted."Father Madeleine," said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raisinghis eyes to the houses, "Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No.87.""Here it is," said Jean Valjean."There is no one in the street," said Fauchelevent. "Give me yourmattock and wait a couple of minutes for me."Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by theinstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked inthe dark, at the door of an attic.A voice replied: "Come in."It was Gribier's voice.Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger's dwelling was, likeall such wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret.A packing-case--a coffin, perhaps--took the place of a commode, abutter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served fora bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on atattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thinwoman and a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of thispoverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. Onewould have said that there had been an earthquake "for one." The coverswere displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother hadbeen crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorousand ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had madea desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the garret,from the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air ofdesperation.But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure totake any notice of this sad side of his success.He entered and said:--"I have brought you back your shovel and pick."Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction."Is it you, peasant?""And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of thecemetery."And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor."What is the meaning of this?" demanded Gribier."The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket,that I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buriedthe corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work,that the porter will return your card to you, and that you will not haveto pay fifteen francs. There you have it, conscript.""Thanks, villager!" exclaimed Gribier, radiant. "The next time I willpay for the drinks."CHAPTER VIII--A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORYAn hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presentedthemselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted theknocker and rapped.They were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer's inthe Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on thepreceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours tremblingsilently and understanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree thatshe wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller hadplied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other replythan a melancholy and unvarying gaze. Cosette had betrayed nothing ofwhat she had seen and heard during the last two days. She divined thatthey were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that it wasnecessary to "be good." Who has not experienced the sovereign powerof those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of aterrified little being: Say nothing! Fear is mute. Moreover, no oneguards a secret like a child.But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, shebeheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that anythoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessedthat it issued from an abyss.Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All thedoors opened.Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out andhow to get in.The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the littleservant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and whichcould still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at thebottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.The porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from thatpoint they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on thepreceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, withher veil lowered, stood beside her.A discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show of lightingthe parlor.The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing whichexamines like a downcast eye.Then she questioned him:--"You are the brother?""Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent."What is your name?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Ultime Fauchelevent."He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead."Where do you come from?"Fauchelevent replied:--"From Picquigny, near Amiens.""What is your age?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Fifty.""What is your profession?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Gardener.""Are you a good Christian?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Every one is in the family.""Is this your little girl?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Yes, reverend Mother.""You are her father?"Fauchelevent replied:--"Her grandfather."The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice"He answers well."Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word.The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to thevocal mother:--"She will grow up ugly."The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in thecorner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:--"Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will berequired now."On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden,and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner oftheir veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, twomen, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. Anenormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to eachother: "He is an assistant gardener."The vocal mothers added: "He is a brother of Father Fauvent."Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belledknee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been theprioress's observation upon Cosette: "She will grow up ugly."The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancyto Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women areconscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beautydo not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverseproportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly thanfrom the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, oldFauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whomhe had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who saidto himself: "He spared me that fine"; with the convent, which, beingenabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixionunder the altar, eluded Caesar and satisfied God. There was a coffincontaining a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body inthe Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbedthereby, but no one was aware of it.As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious ofgardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, theprioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of aconfession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leavingthe convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisperto M. de Latil, Monsieur's confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reimsand Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for itmade its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigningPope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio'sestablishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of DellaGenga; it contained these lines: "It appears that there is in a conventin Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent."Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went ongrafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in the leastsuspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect hisglory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is publishedin the London Illustrated News, with this inscription: "Bull whichcarried off the prize at the Cattle Show."CHAPTER IX--CLOISTEREDCosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean'sdaughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, andthen, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have justobserved, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosettehad suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or tobreathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been withJean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only sheregretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she didsay to Jean Valjean: "Father, if I had known, I would have brought heraway with me."Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to donthe garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in gettingthem to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was thesame mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quittedthe Thenardiers' inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjeanlocked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with aquantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in alittle valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise ona chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his person."Father," Cosette asked him one day, "what is there in that box whichsmells so good?"Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, inaddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knewnothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much lesswork, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, hefound the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used threetimes as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely moreluxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean theother Fauvent.If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert's glance, theywould eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to bedone outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elderFauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never theother; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not howto spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping watchon each other, they paid no heed to this.Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did notstir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of thesky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough toremain happy.A very sweet life began for him.He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company withFauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still inexistence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of threechambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond thewalls. The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjeanhad opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. Thewalls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nailswhereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-noteof '93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which thefollowing is an exact facsimile:--[Illustration: Royalist Bank-note  2b8-9-banknote]This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall bythe preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, andwhose place Fauchelevent had taken.Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself veryuseful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly foundhimself a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew allsorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these toadvantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild.He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As thesisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons andadored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she enteredthe lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomedout and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he affordedCosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, farfrom growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us more radiantthan ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running andplaying in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of therest.For Cosette laughed now.Cosette's face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. Thegloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; itbanishes winter from the human countenance.Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjeangazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look atthe windows of her dormitory.God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,to uphold and complete the Bishop's work in Jean Valjean. It is certainthat virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devilexists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerablynear that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in theconvent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only tothe Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble;but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general,and pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have ended byreturning very gradually to hatred.The convent stopped him on that downward path.This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth,in what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quiterecently again, he had beheld another,--a frightful place, a terribleplace, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity ofjustice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw thecloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys,and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, heconfronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowlydescended the endless spirals of revery.He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose atdawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; theylay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inchesthick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months ofthe year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed,as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a woollencarter's blouse on their backs when it was very cold; they drank nowine, and ate no meat, except when they went on "fatigue duty." Theylived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted, after amanner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with loweredvoices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, withlowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world,not with their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulderslacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished fromamong men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations.They never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remained untilevening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in ablack shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in winter,without the power to add or subtract anything from it; without havingeven, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment or thewoollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge chemiseswhich gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only duringrigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept,not on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally, they werenot even allowed their sleep; every night, after a day of toil, theywere obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, at the momentwhen they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm, to rousethemselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel,with their knees on the stones.On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelvesuccessive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon thepavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.The others were men; these were women.What had those men done? They had stolen, violated, pillaged,murdered, assassinated. They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners,incendiaries, murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They haddone nothing whatever.On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,one thing only, innocence.Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysteriousassumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessingsomething of heaven through holiness.On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged inwhispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And whatcrimes! And what faults!On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the onehand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range ofcannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; onthe other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There,darkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light,and of gleams full of radiance.Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible,a legal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second,perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, thatfaint light of liberty which men call death.In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained byfaith.What flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,hatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, asarcasm against heaven.What results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two speciesof beings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work,expiation.Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; thatpersonal expiation, the expiation for one's self. But he did notunderstand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach andwithout stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation ofwhat? What expiation?A voice within his conscience replied: "The most divine of humangenerosities, the expiation for others."Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; weplace ourselves at Jean Valjean's point of view, and we translate hisimpressions.Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highestpossible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,and which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, tortureaccepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for thesake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanityswallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinctand mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the miseryof those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.And he remembered that he had dared to murmur!Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the gratefulsong of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and theblood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justlychastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that he,wretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God.There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, likea warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, thepassing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk ofdeath, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, whichhe had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made inorder to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his destiny?This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance tothat other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived anidea of anything similar.Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars--to guard whom? Angels.These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld oncemore around lambs.This was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it wasstill more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A cold,harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the barredand padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more bitingbreeze blew in the cage of these doves.Why?When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost inamazement before this mystery of sublimity.In these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heartin all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept.All that had entered into his life for the last six months had led himback towards the Bishop's holy injunctions; Cosette through love, theconvent through humility.Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden wasdeserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk whichskirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed onthe night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he knew,the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayedas he knelt before the sister.It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrantflowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and simplewomen, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by little,his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume likethe flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children.And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which hadreceived him in succession at two critical moments in his life: thefirst, when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him;the second, at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuitof him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and that, had it notbeen for the first, he should have relapsed into crime, and had it notbeen for the second, into torment.His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.Many years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.[THE END OF VOLUME II. "COSETTE"]VOLUME III--MARIUS.[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Three  3frontispiece][Illustration: Titlepage Volume Three  3titlepage]BOOK FIRST.--PARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOMCHAPTER I--PARVULUSParis has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called thesparrow; the child is called the gamin.Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the otherall the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; thereleaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say.This little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes tothe play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body,no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies ofheaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteenyears of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the openair, wears an old pair of trousers of his father's, which descend belowhis heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below hisears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait,rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict,haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women thou, talks slang,sings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart. This is because hehas in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not to be dissolvedin mud. So long as man is in his childhood, God wills that he shall beinnocent.If one were to ask that enormous city: "What is this?" she would reply:"It is my little one."CHAPTER II--SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICSThe gamin--the street Arab--of Paris is the dwarf of the giant.Let us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt,but, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but thenthey have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, forhe finds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there hefinds liberty. He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whosefoundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar metaphors:to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; his own occupations,calling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps, establishing meansof transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains, which hecalls making the bridge of arts, crying discourses pronounced by theauthorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out the cracksin the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all thelittle morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets.This curious money, which receives the name of loques--rags--hasan invariable and well-regulated currency in this little Bohemia ofchildren.Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively inthe corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, thedaddy-long-legs, "the devil," a black insect, which menaces by twistingabout its tail armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster, whichhas scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules onits back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilnsand wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawlssometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has alook, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls thismonster "the deaf thing." The search for these "deaf things" amongthe stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists insuddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice.Each region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures whichare to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of theUrsulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles inthe ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them asTalleyrand. He is no less cynical, but he is more honest. He is endowedwith a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets thecomposure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges boldlyfrom high comedy to farce.A funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is adoctor. "Hey there!" shouts some street Arab, "how long has it beencustomary for doctors to carry home their own work?"Another is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles andtrinkets, turns round indignantly: "You good-for-nothing, you haveseized my wife's waist!"--"I, sir? Search me!"CHAPTER III--HE IS AGREEABLEIn the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds meansto procure, the homuncio enters a theatre. On crossing that magicthreshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomesthe titi.[18] Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with thekeel in the air. It is in that keel that the titi huddle together.The titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same beingendowed with wings and soaring. It suffices for him to be there, withhis radiance of happiness, with his power of enthusiasm and joy, withhis hand-clapping, which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer onthat narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel,the name of Paradise.Bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary,and you have the gamin.The gamin is not devoid of literary intuition. His tendency, and we sayit with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classictaste. He is not very academic by nature. Thus, to give an example, thepopularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little audience of stormychildren was seasoned with a touch of irony. The gamin called herMademoiselle Muche--"hide yourself."This being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like ababy and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in thecesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with hiswit, grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempersAlleluia with Matantur-lurette, chants every rhythm from the DeProfundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he isignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom, islyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the dunghilland emerges from it covered with stars. The gamin of Paris is Rabelaisin this youth.He is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.He is not easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, he makessongs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations, he twitsmysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes the poetry outof stilted things, he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas.It is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but he replaces the solemnvision by the farcical phantasmagoria. If Adamastor were to appear tohim, the street Arab would say: "Hi there! The bugaboo!"CHAPTER IV--HE MAY BE OF USEParis begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, twobeings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, whichcontents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhommeand Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole ofthe monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in thegamin.This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makesconnections, "grows supple" in suffering, in the presence of socialrealities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himselfheedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he ison the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name isPrejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice,Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.The little fellow will grow up.Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handfulof dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. AGod has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tinybeing. By the word "fortune" we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmykneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low.Will that become an Ionian or a Boeotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spiritof Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the menof destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug anamphora.CHAPTER V--HIS FRONTIERSThe gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he has somethingof the sage in him. Urbis amator, like Fuscus; ruris amator, likeFlaccus.To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fineemployment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in thatrather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly butodd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities,notably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginningof the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end ofthe wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur,beginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by thepassing stroller with the epithet: melancholy, the apparently objectlesspromenades of the dreamer.He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriersof Paris, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. Thatclose-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools,those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of earlymarket-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, that mixture ofthe savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrisondrums practise noisily, and produce a sort of lisping of battle, thosehermits by day and cut-throats by night, that clumsy mill which turnsin the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at thecorners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre wallssquarely intersecting immense, vague stretches of land inundated withsunshine and full of butterflies,--all this attracted him.There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with thosesingular spots, the Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelleall speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers onthe bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Platede Chatillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longerserves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on alevel with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna ofRome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothingbut fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, isto remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. Thespot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stampedwith a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appealto you at the same time there. Local originalities there make theirappearance.Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudescontiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos ofParis, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at themost unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of alugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy,dusty, ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned withcorn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escapefrom poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; thesuburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. Therethey innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, orrather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light ofMay or June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles withtheir thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile,free and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than theyrecollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn theirliving, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filledwith cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These encounters with strangechildren are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces ofthe environs of Paris.Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,--are theytheir sisters?--who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, withsunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears ofrye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring cherries amongthe wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups,warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen inthe twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, and thesevisions mingle with his dreams.Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earthto those children. They never venture beyond this. They can no moreescape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from thewater. For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers:Ivry, Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Menilmontant,Choisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Mendon, Issy, Vanvre, Sevres, Puteaux,Neuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnieres,Bougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy,Gonesse; the universe ends there.CHAPTER VI--A BIT OF HISTORYAt the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of thisbook takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman atthe corner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discusshere); stray children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an averageof two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at thatperiod, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in processof construction, and under the arches of the bridges. One of thesenests, which has become famous, produced "the swallows of the bridge ofArcola." This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. Allcrimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relativemeasure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, theexception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child isa lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, insome sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in thepublic vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boyof Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on thesurface, is almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing toput on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of ourpopular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from theidea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water ofthe ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart whichone experiences every time that one meets one of these children aroundwhom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a brokenfamily. In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it stillis, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured familiespouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what hasbecome of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on thepublic highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for thissad thing has given rise to an expression, "to be cast on the pavementsof Paris."Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was notdiscouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia inthe lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims ofthe powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the peoplewas a dogma. What is the use of "half-lights"? Such was the countersign.Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and inthat case it skimmed the streets.Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desiredto create a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us considerthe means. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, thatplaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case ofnecessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, eitherby means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine whatsteamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galleyis moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required.Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments makeas many convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great deal ofcomplaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of aprocession--it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. Achild was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteenyears of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to thegalleys. Grand reign; grand century.Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried themoff, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered withterror monstrous conjectures as to the king's baths of purple. Barbierspeaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that theexempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those whohad fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In thatcase, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts?No, the fathers.CHAPTER VII--THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OFINDIAThe body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One mightalmost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.This word gamin was printed for the first time, and reached popularspeech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little workentitled Claude Gueux that this word made its appearance. The horror waslively. The word passed into circulation.The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for eachother are very various. We have known and associated with one who wasgreatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall fromthe top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded inmaking his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the domeof the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had "prigged" somelead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; stillanother, because he "knew" a soldier who came near putting out the eyeof a citizen.This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profoundepiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,--Dieude Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seenanybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I'ave andfifth pronounced fift'.)Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: "Father So-and-So, yourwife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?""What would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves." But ifthe peasant's whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of thefree-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listeningto his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: "He istalking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!"A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To bestrong-minded is an important item.To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at theguillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: TheEnd of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The LastMouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, hescales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, hesuspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin isborn a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no morefear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an executionon the Place de Greve. Samson and the Abbe Montes are the truly popularnames. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimesadmire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin diebravely, uttered these words which contain a future: "I was jealous ofhim." In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoineis. "Politicians" are confused with assassins in the same legend.They have a tradition as to everybody's last garment. It is known thatTolleron had a fireman's cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat,that old Delaporte was bald and bare-headed, that Castaing was all ruddyand very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that JeanMartin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffe and his mother quarrelled."Don't reproach each other for your basket," shouted a gamin to them.Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being toosmall in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbedit. A gendarme stationed opposite frowned. "Let me climb up, m'sieu legendarme," said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authoritieshe added: "I will not fall." "I don't care if you do," retorted thegendarme.In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a greatdeal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cutone's self very deeply, "to the very bone."The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that thegamin is fondest of saying is: "I am fine and strong, come now!" To beleft-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.CHAPTER VIII--IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THELAST KINGIn summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening,when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena,from the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen's boats, he hurlshimself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions ofthe laws of modesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep aneye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation whichonce gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which wascelebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; itscans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as theeleusiac chant of the Panathenaea, and in it one encounters again theancient Evohe. Here it is: "Ohe, Titi, oheee! Here comes the bobby, herecomes the p'lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer withyou!"Sometimes this gnat--that is what he calls himself--knows how to read;sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. Hedoes not hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutualinstruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, hescrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe wasreturning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee,perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on oneof the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-naturewhich came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the pear,and gave the child a louis, saying: "The pear is on that also."[19]The gamin loves uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him. Heexecrates "the cures." One day, in the Rue de l'Universite, one of thesescamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No.69. "Why are you doing that at the gate?" a passer-by asked. The boyreplied: "There is a cure there." It was there, in fact, that the PapalNuncio lived.Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, ifthe occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possiblethat he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. Thereare two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which he always desireswithout ever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get histrousers sewed up again.The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, andcan always put the name to the face of any one which he chances tomeet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies theirhabits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the soulsof the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and withoutflinching: "Such an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious;such another is great; such another is ridiculous." (All these words:traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning in hismouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, and he preventspeople from walking on the cornice outside the parapet; that other has amania for pulling person's ears; etc., etc.CHAPTER IX--THE OLD SOUL OF GAULThere was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market;Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallicspirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter,as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himselfeternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. CamilleDesmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treatedmiracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when asmall lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and ofSaint-Etienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevievefamiliarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He hasvillainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, andhandsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, hewould go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong onboxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, andstraightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even inthe presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like thelittle Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boywas a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: "Forward!" as the horse of Scripturesays "Vah!" and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to thegiant.This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure thatspread of wings which reaches from Moliere to Barra.To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuseshimself, because he is unhappy.CHAPTER X--ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMOTo sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like thegraeculus of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with thewrinkle of the old world on his brow.The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; adisease which must be cured, how? By light.Light renders healthy.Light kindles.All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts,education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warmyou. Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education willpresent itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth;and then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French ideawill have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins ofParis; flames in the light or will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom.The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The wholeof this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and livingmanners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history withheaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, theTown-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the FaubourgSaint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, aVia Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion;and it replaces the Gemoniae by ridicule. Its majo is called "faraud,"its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is themarket-porter, its lazzarone is the pegre, its cockney is the native ofGhent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwomanof Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, thediscobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer.Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncoeur thegrenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy amongbric-a-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist asjust as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reyniere discoveredlarded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see thetrapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arcof l'Etoile, the sword-eater of Poecilus encountered by Apuleius is asword-swallower on the Pont Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculiothe parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented toCambaceres by d'Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus,Phoedromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from Courtille inLabatut's posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front ofCongrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is nota tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers inthe Cafe Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenorin the Champs-Elysees, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad likeBobeche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the buttonof your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of twothousand years Thesprion's apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehenditpallio? The wine on Surene is a parody of the wine of Alba, the redborder of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro,Pere Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as theEsquiliae, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainlythe equivalent of the slave's hived coffin.Seek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius containsnothing that is not in Mesmer's tub; Ergaphilas lives again inCagliostro; the Brahmin Vasaphanta become incarnate in the Comte deSaint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-Medard works quite as good miraclesas the Mosque of Oumoumie at Damascus.Paris has an AEsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It isterrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; itmakes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on thethrone, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether,if Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better thanMessalina. Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existedand which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and theGascon pun. It mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up aspectre in old numbers of the Constitutional, and makes Chodruc Duclos.Although Plutarch says: the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla asunder Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine. TheTiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by VarusVibiscus is to be credited: Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, BibereTiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci. Paris drinks a million litres ofwater a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating thegeneral alarm and ringing the tocsin.With that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally;it is not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot;provided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it,deformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric andyou may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, doesnot disgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose beforeBasile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horacewas repelled by the "hiccup" of Priapus. No trait of the universal faceis lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymniadance of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies' wearing apparel theredevours the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphylalay in wait for the virgin Planesium. The Barriere du Combat is notthe Coliseum, but people are as ferocious there as though Caesar werelooking on. The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet,but, if Virgil haunted the Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzacand Charlet have sat at the tables of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns.Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper there. Adonai passeson his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder and lightning; Silenusmakes his entry there on his ass. For Silenus read Ramponneau.Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarismsalso. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.A little of the Place de Greve is a good thing. What would all thateternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wiselyprovided, and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.CHAPTER XI--TO SCOFF, TO REIGNThere is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination whichsometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes thefashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Parismay be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury;then the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubsits eyes, says: "How stupid I am!" and bursts out laughing in the faceof the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thingthat this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors,that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all thisparody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of theJudgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereignjoviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days,its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds ofthe universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is themouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks.It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highestmonuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend theireternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to takethe oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in threehours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscleof unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms ofthe sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar,Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it iseverywhere where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779,at the Isle de Leon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, itwhispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the Americanabolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper's Ferry, and in the earof the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi beforethe Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga;it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was whileproceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished atMissolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune underthe feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre;its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, itsphilosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Regnier,Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Molierefor all centuries; it makes its language to be talked by the universalmouth, and that language becomes the word; it constructs in all mindsthe idea of progress, the liberating dogmas which it forges are for thegenerations trusty friends, and it is with the soul of its thinkers andits poets that all heroes of all nations have been made since 1789; thisdoes not prevent vagabondism, and that enormous genius which is calledParis, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in charcoalBouginier's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writesCredeville the thief on the Pyramids.Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it islaughing.Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. Aheap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It ismore than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.To dare; that is the price of progress.All sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. Inorder that the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice thatMontesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, thatBeaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it,that Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; itis necessary that Danton should dare it.The cry: Audacity! is a Fiat lux. It is necessary, for the sake of theforward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons ofcourage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and areone of man's great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises. Toattempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one'sself, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amountof fear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again toinsult drunken victory, to hold one's position, to stand one's ground;that is the example which nations need, that is the light whichelectrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torchof Prometheus to Cambronne's short pipe.CHAPTER XII--THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLEAs for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always thestreet Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for thatreason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It is inthe faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears;there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there thispeople toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces ofman. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whomswarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la Rapee to the knackerof Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds Burke, indignantly;rabble, multitude, populace. These are words and quickly uttered. Butso be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do go barefoot!They do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you abandon themfor that? Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot thelight penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and letus obstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whetherthese opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutionstransfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, thinkaloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize withthe public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly,proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear greenboughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd maybe rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use of that vastconflagration of principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forthand quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, theserags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may beemployed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and youwill perceive truth. Let that vile sand which you trample under foot becast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe there, it will become asplendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that Galileo and Newton willdiscover stars.CHAPTER XIII--LITTLE GAVROCHE[Illustration: Little Gavroche  3b1-13-gavroche]Eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of thisstory, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, and in the regions ofthe Chateau-d'Eau, a little boy eleven or twelve years of age, who wouldhave realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketchedout above, if, with the laugh of his age on his lips, he had not had aheart absolutely sombre and empty. This child was well muffled up in apair of man's trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and awoman's chemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people orother had clothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father anda mother. But his father did not think of him, and his mother did notlove him.He was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, one ofthose who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.This child never felt so well as when he was in the street. Thepavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart.His parents had despatched him into life with a kick.He simply took flight.He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with avivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch,scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gaylylaughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief.He had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry becausehe was free.When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the socialorder meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, theyescape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, everytwo or three months, that he said, "Come, I'll go and see mamma!" Thenhe quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descendedto the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at theSalpetriere, and came to a halt, where? Precisely at that double number50-52 with which the reader is acquainted--at the Gorbeau hovel.At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternallydecorated with the placard: "Chambers to let," chanced to be, a rarething, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always thecase in Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged tothat indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of pettybourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, and which extends from miseryto misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beingsin whom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man whosweeps up the mud, and the ragpicker who collects scraps.The "principal lodger" of Jean Valjean's day was dead and had beenreplaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher hassaid: "Old women are never lacking."This new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkableabout her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned insuccession over her soul.The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family offour persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, alreadywell grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of thecells which we have already mentioned.At first sight, this family presented no very special feature except itsextreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had statedthat his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, which hadborne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all, toborrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this Jondrettehad said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the same timeportress and stair-sweeper: "Mother So-and-So, if any one should chanceto come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a Spaniard,perchance, it is I."This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there andfound distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearthand cold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: "Whence come you?" Hereplied: "From the street." When he went away, they asked him: "Whitherare you going?" He replied: "Into the streets." His mother said to him:"What did you come here for?"This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plantswhich spring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and heblamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother shouldbe.Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.We have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this childwas called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche?Probably because his father's name was Jondrette.It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break thethread.The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was thelast at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it was occupied by avery poor young man who was called M. Marius.Let us explain who this M. Marius was.BOOK SECOND.--THE GREAT BOURGEOISCHAPTER I--NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETHIn the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge therestill exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of aworthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention him with complaisance.This good man was old when they were young. This silhouette has not yetentirely disappeared--for those who regard with melancholy that vagueswarm of shadows which is called the past--from the labyrinth of streetsin the vicinity of the Temple to which, under Louis XIV., the names ofall the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day, thestreets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all thecapitals of Europe; a progression, by the way, in which progress isvisible.M.Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one ofthose men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply becausethey have lived a long time, and who are strange because they formerlyresembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old man,and in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and ratherhaughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good, oldbourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates. Hewas over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he talked loudly, sawclearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored. He had all thirty-two ofhis teeth. He only wore spectacles when he read. He was of an amorousdisposition, but declared that, for the last ten years, he had whollyand decidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, he said; hedid not add: "I am too old," but: "I am too poor." He said: "If I werenot ruined--Heee!" All he had left, in fact, was an income of aboutfifteen thousand francs. His dream was to come into an inheritance andto have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses. He didnot belong, as the reader will perceive, to that puny variety ofoctogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying all their life;his was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial old man had alwayshad good health. He was superficial, rapid, easily angered. He flew intoa passion at everything, generally quite contrary to all reason. Whencontradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he had done in thegreat century. He had a daughter over fifty years of age, and unmarried,whom he chastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, and whom hewould have liked to whip. She seemed to him to be eight years old. Heboxed his servants' ears soundly, and said: "Ah! carogne!" One of hisoaths was: "By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!" He had singularfreaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved every day by a barber whohad been mad and who detested him, being jealous of M. Gillenormand onaccount of his wife, a pretty and coquettish barberess. M. Gillenormandadmired his own discernment in all things, and declared that he wasextremely sagacious; here is one of his sayings: "I have, in truth, somepenetration; I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what woman itcame."The words which he uttered the most frequently were: the sensible man,and nature. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptationwhich our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his ownfashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: "Nature," he said, "inorder that civilization may have a little of everything, gives it evenspecimens of its amusing barbarism. Europe possesses specimens of Asiaand Africa on a small scale. The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizardis a pocket crocodile. The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.They do not eat men, they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, theytransform them into oysters and swallow them. The Caribbeans leave onlythe bones, they leave only the shell. Such are our morals. We do notdevour, we gnaw; we do not exterminate, we claw."CHAPTER II--LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSEHe lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned thehouse. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the numberhas probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which thestreets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartmenton the first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the veryceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representingpastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels wererepeated in miniature on the arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast,nine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung fromthe windows, and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent.The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to thatone of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve orfifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended withgreat agility. In addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had aboudoir of which he thought a great deal, a gallant and elegant retreat,with magnificent hangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers andfleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of hisconvicts by M. de Vivonne for his mistress. M. Gillenormand hadinherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt, who had died acentenarian. He had had two wives. His manners were something betweenthose of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, whichhe might have been. He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind. Inhis youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by theirwives and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the sametime, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers inexistence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his chamber amarvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens, executedwith great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confusedand hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand's attire was not the habit ofLouis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyablesof the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period andhad followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth withvoluminous revers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. Withthis he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his handsinto his fobs. He said authoritatively: "The French Revolution is a heapof blackguards."CHAPTER III--LUC-ESPRITAt the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honorto be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the sametime--ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, theCamargo and the Salle. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroicretreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who wassixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love.He abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: "How pretty shewas--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw herat Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with hercome-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newlyarrived, and her little agitation muff!" He had worn in his youngmanhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking abouteffusively. "I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin," said he.Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty, haddescribed him as "a charming fool." He was horrified by all the nameswhich he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar andbourgeois. He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as hesaid, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. "Oh!" he said, "whatpeople these are! Corbiere! Humann! Casimir Perier! There's a ministerfor you! I can imagine this in a journal: 'M. Gillenorman, minister!'that would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass"; hemerrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, anddid not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarsespeeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lackof astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with theunceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age ofperiphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-fatherhad predicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowedon him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.CHAPTER IV--A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANTHe had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where hewas born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais,whom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the deathof Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, noranything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. TheDuc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. "What acharming grand seigneur," he said, "and what a fine air he had with hisblue ribbon!"In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparationfor the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for threethousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. Hegrew animated on this subject: "The elixir of gold," he exclaimed, "theyellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte's drops, in the eighteenthcentury,--this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, thepanacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV.sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope." He would have been greatlyirritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him that theelixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormandadored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was forever narratingin what manner he had saved himself during the Terror, and how he hadbeen obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order toescape having his head cut off. If any young man ventured to pronouncean eulogium on the Republic in his presence, he turned purple and grewso angry that he was on the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded tohis ninety years, and said, "I hope that I shall not see ninety-threetwice." On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live tobe a hundred.CHAPTER V--BASQUE AND NICOLETTEHe had theories. Here is one of them: "When a man is passionately fondof women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little,who is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on thecode, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himselffrom the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wifecontrol the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then hiswife busies herself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets herfingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the educationof half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers,presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law,follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself thesovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fastand annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges,hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight,and that consoles her. While her husband disdains her, she has thesatisfaction of ruining her husband." This theory M. Gillenormand hadhimself applied, and it had become his history. His wife--the secondone--had administered his fortune in such a manner that, one fine day,when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to him justsufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuityof fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire withhim. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leavea property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies aresubject to adventures, and, for instance, become national property; hehad been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and hehad no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. "All that'sthe Rue Quincampois!" he said. His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavairebelonged to him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, "a maleand a female." When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormandre-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province:Nimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered,short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twentypaces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called himBasque. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (eventhe Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughtycook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself."How much wages do you want a month?" asked M. Gillenormand. "Thirtyfrancs." "What is your name?" "Olympie." "You shall have fifty francs,and you shall be called Nicolette."CHAPTER VI--IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEENWith M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious atbeing in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sortsof liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and hisinternal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that hehad remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for such.This he called having "royal renown." This royal renown sometimes drewdown upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him ina basket, as though it had been a basket of oysters, a stout, newlyborn boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped inswaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six monthspreviously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time,fully completed his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in theestablishment. And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade tobelieve that? What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormandhimself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiablesmile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in anaside: "Well, what now? What's the matter? You are finely taken aback,and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d'Angouleme, thebastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteenwhen he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother tothe Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age ofeighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin, a son, areal child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor ofstate; one of the great men of this century, the Abbe Tabaraud, is theson of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary inthese things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this littlegentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of. It is not hisfault." This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whosename was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was aboy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two bratsback to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for theirmaintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so anymore. He added: "I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well.I shall go to see them from time to time." And this he did. He had hada brother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy ofPoitiers for three and thirty years, and had died at seventy-nine."I lost him young," said he. This brother, of whom but little memoryremains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a priest, thought himselfbound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave themanything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means ofgoing to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, henever haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He waskindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mindwould have been magnificent. He desired that all which concerned himshould be done in a grand manner, even his rogueries. One day, havingbeen cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance, in a grossand apparent manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: "That wasindecently done! I am really ashamed of this pilfering. Everything hasdegenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is not theway to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, butbadly robbed. Silva, sint consule dignae!" He had had two wives, aswe have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who hadremained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had diedat about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance,or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of theRepublic and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and hadbeen made colonel at Waterloo. "He is the disgrace of my family,"said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of snuff, and had aparticularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with theback of one hand. He believed very little in God.CHAPTER VII--RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENINGSuch was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,--whichwas gray rather than white,--and which was always dressed in "dog'sears." To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.He had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous andgreat.In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand,who was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived in the FaubourgSaint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. He had only retiredto the Marais when he quitted society, long after attaining the age ofeighty.And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. Theprincipal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his doorabsolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whateverexcept in the evening. He dined at five o'clock, and after that his doorwas open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would notswerve from it. "The day is vulgar," said he, "and deserves only aclosed shutter. Fashionable people only light up their minds when thezenith lights up its stars." And he barricaded himself against everyone, even had it been the king himself. This was the antiquated eleganceof his day.CHAPTER VIII--TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIRWe have just spoken of M. Gillenormand's two daughters. They had comeinto the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne verylittle resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance,and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible. Theyoungest had a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs tothe light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, whichfluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and waswedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure. Theelder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthypurveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man,or even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in theantechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the haranguesof the town-hall, to be "Madame la Prefete,"--all this had created awhirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, each in herown dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. Both had wings, theone like an angel, the other like a goose.No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradisebecomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of herdreams, but she died. The elder did not marry at all.At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we arerelating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with one ofthe sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possibleto see. A characteristic detail; outside of her immediate family, no onehad ever known her first name. She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand,the elder.In the matter of cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given pointsto a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness.She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man had beheldher garter.Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe wasnever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. Shemultiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking.The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels inproportion as the fortress is the less menaced.Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries ofinnocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew,named Theodule, to embrace her without displeasure.In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: Prude, under which wehave classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. MademoiselleGillenormand was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and ademi-vice.To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belongedto the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,mumbled special orisons, revered "the holy blood," venerated "the sacredheart," remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altarin a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful,and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, andthrough great rays of gilded wood.She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, namedMademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whomMademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyondthe Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge ofanything except of the different ways of making preserves. MademoiselleVaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without asingle spot of intelligence.Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather thanlost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She hadnever been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wearaway the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come toher. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did notherself know the secret. There breathed from her whole person the stuporof a life that was finished, and which had never had a beginning.She kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter nearhim, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him.These households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are notrare, and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning oneach other for support.There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and thisold man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in thepresence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand never addressed this childexcept in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane: "Here, sir!rascal, scoundrel, come here!--Answer me, you scamp! Just let me seeyou, you good-for-nothing!" etc., etc. He idolized him.This was his grandson. We shall meet with this child again later on.BOOK THIRD.--THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSONCHAPTER I--AN ANCIENT SALONWhen M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequentedmany very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M.Gillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of wit,in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly, thatwhich was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much of. Henever went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there.There are people who will have influence at any price, and who will haveother people busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles,they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his dominationin the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respectnothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold hisown against M. de Bonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee.About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house inhis own neighborhood, in the Rue Ferou, with Madame la Baronne de T.,a worthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador ofFrance to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime,had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions, had diedbankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune,some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in ten manuscriptvolumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges. Madame de T. hadnot published the memoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself on ameagre income which had survived no one knew how.Madame de T. lived far from the Court; "a very mixed society," as shesaid, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembledtwice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purelyRoyalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries ofhorror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitutionof the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as thewind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones ofthe hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called Nicolas, werereceived there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicate andcharming women in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets like thefollowing, addressed to "the federates":--               Refoncez dans vos culottes[20]               Le bout d' chemis' qui vous pend.               Qu'on n' dis' pas qu' les patriotes               Ont arbore l' drapeau blanc?There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, withquatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, amoderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:--          Pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base,[21]          Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, "an abominably Jacobinchamber," and from this list they combined alliances of names, in sucha manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: Damas.Sabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr.--All this was done merrily. In that society,they parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desires to givepoint to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little Caira:--               Ah! ca ira ca ira ca ira!               Les Bonapartistes a la lanterne!Songs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-day thishead, to-morrow that. It is only a variation.In the Fualdes affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they tookpart for Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdes was "a Buonapartist." Theydesignated the liberals as friends and brothers; this constituted themost deadly insult.Like certain church towers, Madame de T.'s salon had two cocks. One ofthem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of whomit was whispered about, with a sort of respect: "Do you know? That isthe Lamothe of the affair of the necklace." These singular amnesties dooccur in parties.Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decaythrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the sameway that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who arecold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despisedpersons. The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves abovethis law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour,had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite of? No, because. DuBarry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the houseof M. le Marechal de Richelieu. This society is Olympus. Mercury andthe Prince de Guemenee are at home there. A thief is admitted there,provided he be a god.The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years ofage, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententiousair, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coatbuttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long,flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same coloras his trousers.This M. de Lamothe was "held in consideration" in this salon on accountof his "celebrity" and, strange to say, though true, because of his nameof Valois.As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-ratequality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering inany way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing,dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his greatage added to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years finallyproduce around a head a venerable dishevelment.In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of theold rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored LouisXVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count deRuppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhatas though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the mostdelicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: "All kings who arenot the King of France," said he, "are provincial kings." One day, thefollowing question was put and the following answer returned in hispresence: "To what was the editor of the Courrier Francais condemned?""To be suspended." "Sus is superfluous," observed M. Gillenormand.[22]Remarks of this nature found a situation.At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, hesaid, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: "There goes his Excellency theEvil One."M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tallmademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsomelittle boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trustingeyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmuraround him: "How handsome he is! What a pity! Poor child!" This childwas the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago. He was called "poorchild," because he had for a father "a brigand of the Loire."This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand's son-in-law, who hasalready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called "the disgrace ofhis family."CHAPTER II--ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCHAny one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon atthis epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumentalbridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous ironcable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over theparapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, andtrousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellowwhich had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tannedby the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a largescar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent,prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand,in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on thebridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces,charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were theymuch larger: "these are gardens," and were they a little smaller: "theseare bouquets." All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, andon a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoesof whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosuresand the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone andsolitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young norold, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, whoserved him. The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebratedin the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there.These flowers were his occupation.By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets ofwater, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he hadinvented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have beenforgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled SoulangeBodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for thecultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. Hewas in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting,hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness,sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtfulfor hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of achild in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip ofa spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was veryplain, and he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him giveway, and his servant scolded him. He was so timid that he seemed shy, herarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at hispane and his cure, the Abbe Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if theinhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious tosee his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with asmile. He was the "brigand of the Loire."Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,the Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have beenstruck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the nameof Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had beena soldier in Saintonge's regiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge'sregiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regimentsof the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fallof the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercyfought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, atMayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard'srearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corpsof the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and onlyrejoined the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon had openeda breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He wasunder Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel, wherea ball from a biscaien broke his arm. Then he passed to the frontierof Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Colde Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, andPontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midstof the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say:"Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier." He beheld hisold general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with upliftedsabre, he was shouting: "Forward!" Having been embarked with hiscompany in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a pinnace which wasproceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast, he fell intoa wasps'-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese commanderwanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers betweendecks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy hadthe colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the gunsof the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his audacity havingincreased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured a large Englishtransport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loadeddown with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of thesea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from theArchduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath astorm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirablemarch in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the cavalry ofthe Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew theGuard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,Melas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortiercommanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylauhe was in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroicCaptain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustainedalone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostilearmy. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from thatcemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Beresina,then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles ofGelenhausen; then Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of theMarne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. AtArnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword,and saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up onthis occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his leftarm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had justexchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was calledunder the old regime, the double hand, that is to say, an equal aptitudefor handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a squadron ora battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude, perfected by amilitary education, which certain special branches of the service arise,the dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at oneand the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba. AtWaterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in Dubois' brigade.It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion. He cameand cast the flag at the Emperor's feet. He was covered with blood.While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across hisface. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him: "You are a colonel,you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of Honor!" Pontmercyreplied: "Sire, I thank you for my widow." An hour later, he fell in theravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same"brigand of the Loire."We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo,Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as itwill be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had draggedhimself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of theLoire.The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him intoresidence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King LouisXVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the HundredDays as not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as anofficer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his titleof baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself"Colonel Baron Pontmercy." He had only an old blue coat, and he neverwent out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legionof Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authoritieswould prosecute him for "illegal" wearing of this decoration. When thisnotice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary, Pontmercyretorted with a bitter smile: "I do not know whether I no longerunderstand French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact isthat I do not understand." Then he went out for eight successive dayswith his rosette. They dared not interfere with him. Two or three timesthe Minister of War and the general in command of the department wroteto him with the following address: "A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy."He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken. At the same moment,Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion the missivesof Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to General Bonaparte. Pontmercy had ended,may we be pardoned the expression, by having in his mouth the samesaliva as his Emperor.In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refusedto salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal's spirit.One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets ofVernon, stepped up to him, and said: "Mr. Crown Attorney, am I permittedto wear my scar?"He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He hadhired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived therealone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, hehad found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois,thoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh,saying: "The greatest families are forced into it." In 1815, MadamePontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty insentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving achild. This child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude; but thegrandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that ifthe child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father hadyielded in the little one's interest, and had transferred his love toflowers.Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischiefnor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things whichhe was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed histime in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonelwas "a bandit" to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel,except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to "his Baronship."It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to seehis son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handedover to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercywas a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up thechild in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept theseconditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing rightand sacrificing no one but himself.The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but theinheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternalside, and her sister's son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name wasMarius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one openedhis mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which hisgrandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventuallyenlightened the little boy's mind; he had finally understood somethingof the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions whichwere, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration andslow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only withshame and with a pain at his heart.While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away everytwo or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breakinghis ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour whenAunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the auntshould turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring tobreathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of thatold spinster.From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon, M. l'AbbeMabeuf.That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who hadoften observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his cheek,and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yetwho was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clungto his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he hadencountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized the manof Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure,and both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. Thisvisit led to others. The colonel, who had been extremely reserved atfirst, ended by opening his heart, and the cure and the warden finallycame to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing hishappiness to his child's future. This caused the cure to regard him withveneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fondof the cure. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men sopenetrate each other, and so amalgamate with each other, as an oldpriest and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same. The one hasdevoted his life to his country here below, the other to his country onhigh; that is the only difference.Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George's day, Mariuswrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, andwhich one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this wasall that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them withvery tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.CHAPTER III--REQUIESCANTMadame de T.'s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. Itwas the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. Thisopening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than day, cameto him through this skylight. This child, who had been all joy and lighton entering this strange world, soon became melancholy, and, what isstill more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all those singularand imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious amazement.Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him. There werein Madame de T.'s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, Noe,Levis,--which was pronounced Levi,--Cambis, pronounced Cambyse. Theseantique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child's mindwith the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when theywere all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lightedby a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray orwhite hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colorscould not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words whichwere both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them withfrightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, butpatriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters ofthis ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, privatesecretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published,under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince deBeauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty andwitty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with goldtorsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******, the manin all France who best understood "proportioned politeness," the Comted'Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chevalier dePort-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King'scabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wontto relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in thegalleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishopof Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in thecapacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go atnight and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the personswho had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backsthese dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot ofblood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet atnight. These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon, and bydint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of theundiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard,M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M.Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breechesand his thin legs, sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. deTalleyrand. He had been M. le Comte d'Artois' companion in pleasures andunlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawlon all fours, and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopheravenged by a bailiff. As for the priests, there was the Abbe Halma, thesame to whom M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: "Bah! Whois there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?" The AbbeLetourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbe Frayssinous, who was not, asyet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an oldcassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abbe Keravenant, Cure ofSaint-Germain-des-Pres; also the Pope's Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi,Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long,pensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri,domestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of theHoly See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of thesaints, Postulatore dei Santi, which refers to matters of canonization,and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the section ofParadise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl******T*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have,a few years later, the honor of signing in the Conservateur articlesside by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishopof Toul****, and often made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquisde T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The Cardinal ofCl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his redstockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred ofthe Encyclopaedia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons who,at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, wherethe hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the shockof the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to hisconclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: "Mark,Abbe, I make a cannon." The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had beenbrought to Madame de T.'s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure,former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure wasnotable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy; throughthe glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the FrenchAcademy then held its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday,contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshlypowdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparentlyfor the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar. Allthese ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers aschurchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorialaspect was accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****,the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***,and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince deMon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea ofFrance and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium.It was he who said: "The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome;the lords are the peers of France of England." Moreover, as it isindispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century,this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M.Gillenormand reigned there.There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had heentered there, would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene. Some ofthe scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. ComteBeug*** was received there, subject to correction.The "noble" salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons.The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists ofto-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.At Madame de T.'s the society was superior, taste was exquisite andhaughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners thereadmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the oldregime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especiallyin the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficiallyacquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was onlyantique. A woman was called Madame la Generale. Madame la Colonelle wasnot entirely disused. The charming Madame de Leon, in memory, nodoubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, preferred thisappellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de Crequy was alsocalled Madame la Colonelle.It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries therefinement of speaking to the King in private as the King, in the thirdperson, and never as Your Majesty, the designation of Your Majestyhaving been "soiled by the usurper."Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,which released them from the necessity of understanding it. They abettedeach other in amazement. They communicated to each other that modicumof light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information onEpimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the courseof things. They declared that the time which had elasped since Coblentzhad not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the graceof God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were,by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence.All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amountedto a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus.There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The liveries inthe antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete personages wereserved by domestics of the same stamp.They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinatelyresisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted ofConserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor,--that was thepoint. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions of these venerablegroups, and their ideas smelled of it. It was a mummified society. Themasters were embalmed, the servants were stuffed with straw.A worthy old marquise, an emigree and ruined, who had but a solitarymaid, continued to say: "My people."What did they do in Madame de T.'s salon? They were ultra.To be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not havedisappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let usexplain it.To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name ofthe throne, and the mitre in the name of the attar; it is to ill-treatthe thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it isto cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received byheretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry;it is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that thePope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficientlyroyal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontentedwith alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name ofwhiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becomingtheir enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of theRestoration.Nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in1814 and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villele,the practical man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinarymoment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling andsombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, atthe same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which stillfilled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past. There existedin that light and that shadow, a complete little new and old world,comic and sad, juvenile and senile, which was rubbing its eyes; nothingresembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded Francewith ill-temper, and which France regarded with irony; good old owlsof marquises by the streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the"former" subjects of amazement at everything, brave and noble gentlemenwho smiled at being in France but wept also, delighted to beholdtheir country once more, in despair at not finding their monarchy; thenobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is tosay, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who hadlost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagnedisdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have justremarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable andnothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious andwas only a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People nolonger had the feeling for what was grand. There was some one who calledBonaparte Scapin. This Society no longer exists. Nothing of it, werepeat, exists to-day. When we select from it some one figure at random,and attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as strange to usas the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a matter offact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared beneath twoRevolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover all that itis their mission to destroy and to bury, and how promptly they createfrightful gulfs!Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid timeswhen M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.These salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believedin Fievee. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M.Colnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleonwas to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction intohistory of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King'sarmies, was a concession to the spirit of the age.These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818,doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their waywas to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where theultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They hadwit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnatedwith arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefullytoo, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttonedcoats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was tocreate aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed ofengrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle.They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservativeliberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say:"Thanks for Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It hasbrought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful,brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled, though with regret,the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of thenation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire,glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But thismistake which it makes with regard to us,--have we not sometimes beenguilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought tobe intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction ofliberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France iswanting in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards itsmother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, thenobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire wastreated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we areunjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have somethingto proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of LouisXIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. deVaublanc for erasing the N's from the bridge of Jena! What was it thathe did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo.The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N's. That is our patrimony. Towhat purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in thepast any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history?Why not love the whole of France?"It is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism, whichwas displeased at criticism and furious at protection.The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregationcharacterized the second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselveshere to this sketch.In the course of this narrative, the author of this book has encounteredin his path this curious moment of contemporary history; he has beenforced to cast a passing glance upon it, and to trace once more some ofthe singular features of this society which is unknown to-day. But hedoes it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea. Souvenirs bothrespectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother, attach him tothis past. Moreover, let us remark, this same petty world had a grandeurof its own. One may smile at it, but one can neither despise nor hateit. It was the France of former days.Marius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When heemerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confidedhim to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. Thisyoung soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant.Marius went through his years of college, then he entered the lawschool. He was a Royalist, fanatical and severe. He did not love hisgrandfather much, as the latter's gayety and cynicism repelled him, andhis feelings towards his father were gloomy.He was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud,religious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.CHAPTER IV--END OF THE BRIGANDThe conclusion of Marius' classical studies coincided with M.Gillenormand's departure from society. The old man bade farewell tothe Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.'s salon, and establishedhimself in the Mardis, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed andpursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, onhis return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand."Marius," said M. Gillenormand, "you will set out for Vernon to-morrow.""Why?" said Marius."To see your father."Marius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everythingexcept this--that he should one day be called upon to see his father.Nothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admitit, more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement intoreconciliation. It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant duty.Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was convincedthat his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand called him on hisamiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had abandonedhim to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love."Nothing is more simple," he said to himself.He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. Thegrandfather resumed:--"It appears that he is ill. He demands your presence."And after a pause, he added:--"Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves theCour des Fontaines at six o'clock, and which arrives in the evening.Take it. He says that here is haste."Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.Marius might have set out that very evening and have been with hisfather on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloitook the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed through Vernon.Neither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it.The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were justbeginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom hemet for "M. Pontmercy's house." For in his own mind, he agreed with theRestoration, and like it, did not recognize his father's claim to thetitle of either colonel or baron.The house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little lamp inher hand opened the door."M. Pontmercy?" said Marius.The woman remained motionless."Is this his house?" demanded Marius.The woman nodded affirmatively."Can I speak with him?"The woman shook her head."But I am his son!" persisted Marius. "He is expecting me.""He no longer expects you," said the woman.Then he perceived that she was weeping.She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he entered.In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on thechimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, anotherkneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. Theone on the floor was the colonel.The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged inprayer.The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. Ashe had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, hehad written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grownworse. On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, the colonel hadhad an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of theservant's efforts to prevent him, crying: "My son is not coming! I shallgo to meet him!" Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on thefloor of the antechamber. He had just expired.The doctor had been summoned, and the cure. The doctor had arrived toolate. The son had also arrived too late.By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished onthe pale and prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled from hisdead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. Thattear was his son's delay.Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on thatvenerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on thosewhite locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brownlines, marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicatedbullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that gigantic sear whichstamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprintedgoodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this manwas dead, and a chill ran over him.The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in thepresence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out indeath.Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman waslamenting in a corner, the cure was praying, and his sobs were audible,the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst oftheir affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed athis own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on thefloor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him ofthe strength to hold it.At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself forbehaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love hisfather? Why should he!The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid theexpenses of his burial.The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. Itcontained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:--"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field ofWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he willbe worthy of it is a matter of course." Below, the colonel had added:"At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man'sname was Thenardier. I think that he has recently been keeping alittle inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles orMontfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can toThenardier."Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious inthe heart of man.Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword anduniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated thegarden and pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to nettlesand weeds, and died.Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment hereturned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies, withno more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In twodays the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.Marius wore crape on his hat. That was all.CHAPTER V--THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME AREVOLUTIONISTMarius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday,when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of theVirgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himselfbehind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual onthat occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon achair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:Monsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presentedhimself and said to Marius:--"This is my place, sir."Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of hischair.The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant;the old man approached him again and said:--"I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and foragain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive,and I will explain myself.""There is no need of that, Sir," said Marius."Yes!" went on the old man, "I do not wish you to have a bad opinion ofme. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the massis better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, thatI have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or threemonths, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity andno other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by familyarrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would bebrought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father wasthere. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor innocent!The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazedat his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow, poor man! Icould see that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I havecontracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer itto the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knewthat unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthyaunt, relatives, I don't know exactly what all, who threatened todisinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himselfin order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separatedfrom him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve ofpolitical opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop.Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a fatheris not separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one ofBonaparte's colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where Ihave a brother who is a cure, and his name was something like Pontmarieor Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on my honor.""Pontmercy," suggested Marius, turning pale."Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?""Sir," said Marius, "he was my father."The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:--"Ah! you are the child! Yes, that's true, he must be a man by thistime. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved youdearly!"Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:--"I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you permit meto be absent for three days?""Four!" replied his grandfather. "Go and amuse yourself."And he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, "Some loveaffair!"CHAPTER VI--THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDENWhere it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, wentstraight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of theMoniteur.He read the Moniteur, he read all the histories of the Republic andthe Empire, the Memorial de Sainte-Helene, all the memoirs, all thenewspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.The first time that he came across his father's name in the bulletins ofthe grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the generalsunder whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte H.Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the lifeat Vernon, the colonel's retreat, his flowers, his solitude. Marius cameto a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man, that speciesof lion-lamb who had been his father.In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed allhis moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands atall. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and hewas not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. "Bah! bah! He is justof the age for the girls!" Sometimes the old man added: "The deuce!I thought it was only an affair of gallantry, It seems that it is anaffair of passion!"It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring hisfather.At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. Thephases of this change were numerous and successive. As this is thehistory of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful tofollow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.The first effect was to dazzle him.Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him onlymonstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire,a sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, and where he hadexpected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with a sortof unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars sparkling,Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille, Desmoulins,Danton, and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not know where he stood. Herecoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little, when hisastonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this radiance, hecontemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these personageswithout terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselvesluminously, in perspective, before his mind's eye; he beheld each ofthese groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: theRepublic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses,the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; hebeheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, andthe grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. He assertedin his conscience, that all this had been good. What his dazzled stateneglected in this, his first far too synthetic estimation, we do notthink it necessary to point out here. It is the state of a mind on themarch that we are recording. Progress is not accomplished in one stage.That stated, once for all, in connection with what precedes as well aswith what is to follow, we continue.He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended hiscountry no more than he had comprehended his father. He had not knowneither the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscuredhis eyes. Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the otherhe adored.He was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair thatall he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if hisfather had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, inhis compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be stillamong the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitatedhimself, how he would have cried to his father: "Father! Here I am! Itis I! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!" How he would haveembraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar,pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had hisfather died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love ofhis son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, whichsaid to him every moment: "Alas!" At the same time, he became more trulyserious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. Ateach instant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inwardgrowth seemed to be in progress within him. He was conscious of a sortof natural enlargement, which gave him two things that were new tohim--his father and his country.As everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself thatwhich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; henceforthhe plainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of thegreat things which he had been taught to detest, and of the great menwhom he had been instructed to curse. When he reflected on his formeropinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which, nevertheless,seemed to him already so very ancient, he grew indignant, yet he smiled.From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to therehabilitation of Napoleon.But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all itsinterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execratedhim even more than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned tosufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred ofmothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in orderto paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we latelypointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, fromthat which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which isterrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, inspeaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up withlaughter, provided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had neverentertained--about that man, as he was called--any other ideas in hismind. They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature.There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents andmaterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyesof Marius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense,and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, onthe score of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw moredistinctly; and he set about mounting, slowly, step by step, almostregretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as thoughattracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, thenthe vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid stepsof enthusiasm.One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candlewas burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table closeto the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, andmingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dullsounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, whichis twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand,the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophespenned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld hisfather's name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that greatEmpire presented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and risingwithin him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed closeto him like a breath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got intoa singular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets,the measured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of thecavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazedupon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measurelessdepths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there theybeheld other colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contractedwithin him. He was in a transport, trembling, panting. All at once,without himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he wasobeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window,gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, theeternal immensity, and exclaimed: "Long live the Emperor!"From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,--theusurper,--the tyrant,--the monster who was the lover of his ownsisters,--the actor who took lessons of Talma,--the poisoner ofJaffa,--the tiger,--Buonaparte,--all this vanished, and gave placein his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at aninaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Caesar. The Emperor hadbeen for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, forwhom one sacrifices one's self; he was something more to Marius. He wasthe predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Romangroup in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect,of a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of HenryIV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety,having his spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man,that is to say; but august in his faults, brilliant in his spots,powerful in his crime.He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: "Thegreat nation!" He was better than that, he was the very incarnation ofFrance, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the worldby the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectrewhich will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard thefuture. Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic andsumming up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as JesusChrist is the man-God.It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, hisconversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesionand he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downwardslope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticismfor the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind hisenthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius,and pell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he wasinstalling in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand thatwhich is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, hehad set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. Thereis a way of encountering error while on one's way to the truth. He had aviolent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the newpath which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime,as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuatingcircumstances.At all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerlybeheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. Hisorientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He hadturned squarely round.All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his familyobtaining an inkling of the case.When, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbonand ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite andthe Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundlydemocratic and republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai desOrfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name: Le Baron MariusPontmercy.This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which hadtaken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round hisfather.Only, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with anyporter, he put them in his pocket.By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to hisfather, to the latter's memory, and to the things for which thecolonel had fought five and twenty years before, he receded from hisgrandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand's temper didnot please him. There already existed between them all the dissonancesof the grave young man and the frivolous old man. The gayety of Geronteshocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the samepolitical opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both,Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridgefell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Mariusexperienced unutterable impulses to revolt, when he reflected that itwas M. Gillenormand who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlesslyfrom the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the childof the father.By dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversionfor his grandfather.Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we havealready said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and rarein the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle andalleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext.His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis: "In love!I know all about it."From time to time Marius absented himself."Where is it that he goes off like this?" said his aunt.On one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went toMontfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father hadleft him, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeperThenardier. Thenardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knewwhat had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days onthis quest."He is getting decidedly wild," said his grandfather.They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast,under his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.CHAPTER VII--SOME PETTICOATWe have mentioned a lancer.He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side,who led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestichearth. Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditionsrequired to make what is called a fine officer. He had "a lady's waist,"a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustachein a hook. He visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius hadnever seen him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We thinkwe have said that Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, whopreferred him because she did not see him. Not seeing people permits oneto attribute to them all possible perfections.One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to herapartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing.Marius had just asked his grandfather's permission to take a littletrip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening. "Go!" had beenhis grandfather's reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, ashe raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: "Here he is passingthe night out again." Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended toher chamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped thisexclamation: "This is too much!"--and this interrogation: "But where isit that he goes?" She espied some adventure of the heart, more or lessillicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she wouldnot have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting amystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; sainted soulsdo not detest this. There is some curiosity about scandal in the secretcompartments of bigotry.So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyondher wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping,with one layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of theEmpire and the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels.The work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had been seated at this forseveral hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raisedher nose. Lieutenant Theodule stood before her, making the regulationsalute. She uttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be aprude, one may be pious, one may be an aunt, but it is always agreeableto see a lancer enter one's chamber."You here, Theodule!" she exclaimed."On my way through town, aunt.""Embrace me.""Here goes!" said Theodule.And he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and openedit."You will remain with us a week at least?""I leave this very evening, aunt.""It is not possible!""Mathematically!""Remain, my little Theodule, I beseech you.""My heart says 'yes,' but my orders say 'no.' The matter is simple.They are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are beingtransferred to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in orderto get from the old post to the new one. I said: 'I am going to see myaunt.'""Here is something for your trouble."And she put ten louis into his hand."For my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt."Theodule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some ofthe skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform."Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?" she askedhim."No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. My servant istaking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I wantto ask you something.""What is it?""Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?""How do you know that?" said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quickwith a lively curiosity."On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe.""Well?""A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I sawhis name on the card.""What name?""Marius Pontmercy.""The wicked fellow!" exclaimed his aunt. "Ah! your cousin is not asteady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in adiligence!""Just as I am going to do.""But you--it is your duty; in his case, it is wildness.""Bosh!" said Theodule.Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,--an ideastruck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped her brow. Sheapostrophized Theodule:--"Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?""No. I have seen him; but he has never deigned to notice me.""So you are going to travel together?""He in the imperial, I in the coupe.""Where does this diligence run?""To Andelys.""Then that is where Marius is going?""Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon,in order to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius'plan of travel.""Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius?While you, at least, are called Theodule.""I would rather be called Alfred," said the officer."Listen, Theodule.""I am listening, aunt.""Pay attention.""I am paying attention.""You understand?""Yes.""Well, Marius absents himself!""Eh! eh!""He travels.""Ah! ah!""He spends the night out.""Oh! oh!""We should like to know what there is behind all this."Theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:--"Some petticoat or other."And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:--"A lass.""That is evident," exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard M.Gillenormand speaking, and who felt her conviction become irresistibleat that word fillette, accentuated in almost the very same fashion bythe granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:--"Do us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does not know you, it will beeasy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must writeus the tale. It will amuse his grandfather."Theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying; but he was muchtouched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a possiblesequel. He accepted the commission and said: "As you please, aunt."And he added in an aside, to himself: "Here I am a duenna."Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him."You are not the man to play such pranks, Theodule. You obey discipline,you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and duty, and youwould not quit your family to go and see a creature."The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for hisprobity.Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligencewithout suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, thefirst thing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete andconscientious. Argus snored all night long.At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: "Vernon! relay ofVernon! Travellers for Vernon!" And Lieutenant Theodule woke."Good," he growled, still half asleep, "this is where I get out."Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, herecalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he hadundertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This sethim to laughing."Perhaps he is no longer in the coach," he thought, as he rebuttoned thewaistcoat of his undress uniform. "He may have stopped at Poissy; he mayhave stopped at Triel; if he did not get out at Meulan, he may have gotout at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, or if he did not go onas far as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at Evreus, or tothe right at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What the devil am I towrite to that good old soul?"At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial,made its appearance at the window of the coupe."Can that be Marius?" said the lieutenant.It was Marius.A little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilionsat the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. "Giveyour ladies flowers!" she cried.Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flatbasket."Come now," said Theodule, leaping down from the coupe, "this piques mycuriosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? Shemust be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet. I want to seeher."And no longer in pursuance of orders, but from personal curiosity, likedogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.Marius paid no attention to Theodule. Elegant women descended from thediligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing aroundhim."He is pretty deeply in love!" thought Theodule.Marius directed his steps towards the church."Capital," said Theodule to himself. "Rendezvous seasoned with a bit ofmass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passesover the good God's head."On arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted theapse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse."The rendezvous is appointed outside," said Theodule. "Let's have a lookat the lass."And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Mariushad turned.On arriving there, he halted in amazement.Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon thegrass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity ofthe grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stooda cross of black wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARONPONTMERCY. Marius' sobs were audible.The "lass" was a grave.CHAPTER VIII--MARBLE AGAINST GRANITEIt was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of hisabsenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every timethat M. Gillenormand had said: "He is sleeping out."Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by thisunexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular anddisagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and whichwas composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for thecolonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, andthere was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with largeepaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowingwhat to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it isprobable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery madeby Theodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of thosemysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene atVernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of themorning, descended at his grandfather's door, and, wearied by the twonights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing hisloss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly tohis chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat,and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to thebath.M. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health,had heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as hisold legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived,in order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to findout where he had been.But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had toascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was nolonger there.The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but notdefiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon."I like this better," said M. Gillenormand.And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, whereMademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering hercart-wheels.The entrance was a triumphant one.M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other theneck-ribbon, and exclaimed:--"Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going tolearn the most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on thedebaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I havethe portrait!"In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, wassuspended from the ribbon.The old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without openingit, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with which a poorhungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him, passunder his very nose."For this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. That isworn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable frightthat will make us shudder, probably! Young men have such bad tastenowadays!""Let us see, father," said the old spinster.The case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothingbut a carefully folded paper."From the same to the same," said M. Gillenormand, bursting withlaughter. "I know what it is. A billet-doux.""Ah! let us read it!" said the aunt.And she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read asfollows:--"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield ofWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he willbe worthy of it is a matter of course."The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They feltchilled as by the breath of a death's-head. They did not exchange aword.Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking tohimself:--"It is the slasher's handwriting."The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then putit back in its case.At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fellfrom one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormandpicked it up and unfolded the blue paper.It contained Marius' hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.Gillenormand, who read: Le Baron Marius Pontmercy.The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took theribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in themiddle of the room, and said:--"Carry those duds away."A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the oldspinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and werethinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:--"A pretty stateof things!"A few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even beforehe had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one ofhis own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latterexclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which wassomething crushing:--"Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you mycompliments. What is the meaning of this?"Marius reddened slightly and replied:--"It means that I am the son of my father."M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:--"I am your father.""My father," retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, "wasa humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, wholived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot andbullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured twoflags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten and abandoned, andwho never committed but one mistake, which was to love too fondly twoingrates, his country and myself."This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the wordrepublic, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his feet.Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of theold Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazingbrand. From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and frompurple, flame-colored."Marius!" he cried. "Abominable child! I do not know what your fatherwas! I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not knowhim! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrelsamong those men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! Isay all! I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius!See here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They were allbandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-naparte werebrigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, betrayed theirlegitimate king! All cowards who fled before the Prussians and theEnglish at Waterloo! That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur yourfather comes in that category, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so muchthe worse, your humble servant!"In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormandwho was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know whatwould happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholdsall his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds apasser-by spit upon his idol. It could not be that such things had beenuttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just beentrampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom? Byhis grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging theother? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it wasequally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the onehand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated,with all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raisedhis eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice ofthunder:--"Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!"Louis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same tohim.The old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. Hewheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on thechimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar majesty.Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace to thewindow and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the whole lengthof the room, and making the polished floor creak as though he had been astone statue walking.On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching thisencounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to herwith a smile that was almost calm: "A baron like this gentleman, and abourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof."And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, withhis brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, heextended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him:--"Be off!"Marius left the house.On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:"You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker,and you will never mention his name to me."Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowingwhat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as you insteadof thou for the next three months.Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was onecircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domesticdramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality,the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius' "duds"precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather's command, Nicolettehad, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, whichwas dark, that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paperpenned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found.Marius was convinced that "Monsieur Gillenormand"--from that day forthhe never alluded to him otherwise--had flung "his father's testament" inthe fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written,and, consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, thatsacred relic,--all that was his very heart. What had been done with it?Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, andwithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothesin a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by thehour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latinquarter.What was to become of Marius?BOOK FOURTH.--THE FRIENDS OF THE A B CCHAPTER I--A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORICAt that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certainrevolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had startedforth from the depths of '89 and '93 were in the air. Youth was onthe point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People wereundergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it,through the movement of the age. The needle which moves round thecompass also moves in souls. Each person was taking that step in advancewhich he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals,liberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide complicated witha thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to createintermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; peopleadored both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here. Thesewere the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases. Voltairianroyalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular sequel, Bonapartistliberalism.Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, theysounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. Theygrew enthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infiniterealizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towardsthe sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothinglike dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreamsfor engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.These advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mysterymenaced "the established order of things," which was suspicious andunderhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. Thesecond thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace inthe mine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to thepremeditation of coups d'etat.There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlyingorganizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; buthere and there there were dark underminings, which were in process ofthrowing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; thereexisted at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the societyof the Friends of the A B C.What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its objectapparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,--thedebased,--that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people.It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimesserious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which madea general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness:Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society inthe state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended inheroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market,in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later on,and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel calledthe Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places wasclose to the workingman, the second to the students.The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a backroom of the Cafe Musain.This hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with which it wasconnected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exitwith a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres. There they smokedand drank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loudtones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old mapof France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,--a sign quitesufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who wereon cordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of theprincipal ones. They belong, in a certain measure, to history: Enjolras,Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle orLaigle, Joly, Grantaire.These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship.All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.[Illustration: Friends of the A B C  3b4-1-abc-friends]This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths whichlie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached,it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon theseyouthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadowof a tragic adventure.Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the reader shallsee why later on,--was an only son and wealthy.Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. Hewas angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have said,to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already,in some previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionaryapocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been awitness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of the greataffair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth. Hewas an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate point ofview, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary movement, thepriest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, hislower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty. Agreat deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view.Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end ofthe last, who became illustrious at an early age, he was endowed withexcessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl, although subject tohours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two andtwenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did notseem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman.He had but one passion--the right; but one thought--to overthrowthe obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in theConvention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, heignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the barethroat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have movedAristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothingexcept to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments. Hechastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic.He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired,and had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts ofsoul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him!If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais,seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's mien,those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in thewind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, hadconceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beautyon Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shownher the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mightycherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of theRevolution and its philosophy there exists this difference--that itslogic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace.Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, butbroader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles ofgeneral ideas: he said: "Revolution, but civilization"; and around themountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolutionwas more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right.The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himselfto Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the worldmore than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men toattain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the wiseman. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane. Homo andvir, that was the exact effect of their different shades. Combeferre wasas gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. He lovedthe word citizen, but he preferred the word man. He would gladlyhave said: Hombre, like the Spanish. He read everything, went tothe theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, learned thepolarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a lesson inwhich Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of theexternal carotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face,and the one which makes the brain; he kept up with what was goingon, followed science step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier,deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble which he found and reasonedon geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faultyFrench in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze,affirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts;turned over the files of the Moniteur, reflected. He declared that thefuture lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, and busied himself witheducational questions. He desired that society should labor withoutrelaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, atcoining science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing themind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty ofmethod, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to twoor three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of officialpedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting ourcolleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact,a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time,thoughtful "even to chimaeras," so his friends said. He believed inall dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgicaloperations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electrictelegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmedby the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction, bysuperstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who thinkthat science will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief,Combeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one andto march behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable offighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, andto attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better tobring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means ofeducation, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws;and, between two lights, his preference was rather for illumination thanfor conflagration. A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, butwhy not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes astill better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whitenessof the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke,progress purchased at the expense of violence, only half satisfied thistender and serious spirit. The headlong precipitation of a people intothe truth, a '93, terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was stillmore repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on thewhole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to thecesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. Inshort, he desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends,captivated by the absolute, adored and invoked splendid revolutionaryadventures, Combeferre was inclined to let progress, good progress, takeits own course; he may have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, butirreproachable; phlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would haveknelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in allits candor, and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuousevolution of the races. The good must be innocent, he repeatedincessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consistsin keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thitherathwart the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beautyof progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington,who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, thatdifference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of aneagle.Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His namewas Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with thepowerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential studyof the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a potof flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitiedwoman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the sameconfidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of aroyal head, that of Andre Chenier. His voice was ordinarily delicate,but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost anOrientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to thosewho know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter ofpoetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, andHebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante,Juvenal, AEschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille toRacine, and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille. He loved to saunter throughfields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself with cloudsnearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one onthe side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied orhe contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions,salary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought,education, penal servitude, poverty, association, property, productionand sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the humanant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, thoseenormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He spokesoftly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with embarrassment,dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere nothing, and wasvery timid. Yet he was intrepid.Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father andmother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had butone thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, toeducate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taughthimself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned byhimself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace wasimmense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother hadfailed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profounddivination of the man of the people, over what we now call the idea ofthe nationality, had learned history with the express object of ragingwith full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He hadfor his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He utteredthese names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with thetenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, ofRussia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things,the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereigneloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with thateloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on thesubject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and thatthree-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and patternof all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time,have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate ofbirth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin inthe partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of whichall present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not beena despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed,approved, counter-signed, and copied, ne variatur, the partition ofPoland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was thefirst thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consultedthat crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly's habitual text. Thispoor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and sherecompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there iseternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can beTeuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to makethem so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface andreappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. Theprotest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of anation cannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascalityhave no future. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pockethandkerchief.Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One ofthe false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regardsaristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle. Theparticle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. But thebourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly that poor de,that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. M. de Chauvelinhad himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M. Caumartin; M. deConstant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. de Lafayette, M. Lafayette.Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called himselfplain Courfeyrac.We might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here,and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: "ForCourfeyrac, see Tholomyes."Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be calledthe beaute du diable of the mind. Later on, this disappears like theplayfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois,on two legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of thesuccessive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it fromhand to hand, quasi cursores, and is almost always exactly the same;so that, as we have just pointed out, any one who had listened toCourfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyes in 1817. Only,Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similaritiesof the exterior mind, the difference between him and Tholomyes was verygreat. The latent man which existed in the two was totally differentin the first from what it was in the second. There was in Tholomyes adistrict attorney, and in Courfeyrac a paladin.Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was thecentre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is,that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and radiance.Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasionof the burial of young Lallemand.Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, aspendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, andat times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellowpossible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; a wholesaleblusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unlessit were an uprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it werea revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up thepavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it;a student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did notpractise it. He had taken for his device: "Never a lawyer," and for hisarmorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Everytime that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttonedup his frock-coat,--the paletot had not yet been invented,--and tookhygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: "What a fineold man!" and of the dean, M. Delvincourt: "What a monument!" In hislectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors occasionsfor caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something likethree thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect fortheir son.He said of them: "They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is thereason they are intelligent."Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; the othershad habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To saunteris Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of athinker than appeared to view.He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C andother still unorganized groups, which were destined to take form lateron.In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.The Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for having assistedhim to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wontto relate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King wasdisembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition."What is your request?" said the King."Sire, a post-office.""What is your name?""L'Aigle."The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheldthe name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonoparte orthography touchedthe King and he began to smile. "Sire," resumed the man with thepetition, "I had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamedLesgueules. This surname furnished my name. I am called Lesgueules, bycontraction Lesgle, and by corruption l'Aigle." This caused the Kingto smile broadly. Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux,either intentionally or accidentally.The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or Legle, andhe signed himself, Legle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, his companionscalled him Bossuet.Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow. His specialty was not to succeedin anything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twentyhe was bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; buthe, the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a badspeculation. He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, butall he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived him;what he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were splittingwood, he cut off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discoveredthat he had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him every moment,hence his joviality. He said: "I live under falling tiles." He wasnot easily astonished, because, for him, an accident was what he hadforeseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing offate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, buthis fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his last sou,never his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered his doors, hesaluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped all catastrophes onthe stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it byits nickname: "Good day, Guignon," he said to it.These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full ofresources. He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good tohim, to indulge in "unbridled extravagance." One night, he went so faras to eat a "hundred francs" in a supper with a wench, which inspiredhim to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: "Pull off myboots, you five-louis jade."Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of alawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel.Bossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged now withone, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was studying medicine.He was two years younger than Bossuet.Joly was the "malade imaginaire" junior. What he had won in medicine wasto be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three and twenty he thoughthimself a valetudinarian, and passed his life in inspecting his tonguein the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, andin his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and thefoot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his bloodmight not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe.During thunder storms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayestof them all. All these young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences livedin harmony together, and the result was an eccentric and agreeablebeing whom his comrades, who were prodigal of winged consonants, calledJolllly. "You may fly away on the four L's," Jean Prouvaire said tohim.[23]Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which isan indication of a sagacious mind.All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, canonly be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.All were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy ofthem became solemn when they pronounced that date: '89. Their fathers inthe flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not what;this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not concernthem at all; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins. Theyattached themselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible rightand absolute duty.Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there wasone sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic's namewas Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with thisrebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe inanything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the mostduring their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be hadat the Cafe Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire, thatgood cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevarddu Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotesat the Barriere de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at theBarriere du Com pat. He knew the best place for everything; inaddition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thoroughsingle-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He wasinordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, IrmaBoissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him asfollows: "Grantaire is impossible"; but Grantaire's fatuity was not tobe disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with theair of saying to them all: "If I only chose!" and of trying to make hiscomrades believe that he was in general demand.All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the socialcontract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity,civilization, religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothingwhatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of theintelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with irony.This was his axiom: "There is but one certainty, my full glass." Hesneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as thebrother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. "They are greatly inadvance to be dead," he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: "There is agibbet which has been a success." A rover, a gambler, a libertine,often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:"J'aimons les filles, et j'aimons le bon vin." Air: Vive Henri IV.However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither adogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras.Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did thisanarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? Tothe most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By hisideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable.A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law ofcomplementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves thelight like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toadalways has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird inits flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faithsoar in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm,upright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearlyaware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself havingoccurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft,yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselvesto Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on thatfirmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one oncemore. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were,to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. Hisindifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but hisheart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction;for an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. Thereare men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrongside. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja.They only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man;their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunctionand; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of anexistence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He wasthe obverse of Enjolras.One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of thealphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.Grantaire, Enjolras' true satellite, inhabited this circle of young men;he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he followed themeverywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumesof wine. They tolerated him on account of his good humor.Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober manhimself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity.Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by Enjolras,roughly repulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge, he said ofEnjolras: "What fine marble!"CHAPTER II--BLONDEAU'S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUETOn a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, somecoincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was tobe seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the CafeMusain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothingbut his revery, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel.To lean one's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down whilestanding erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de Meauxwas pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure whichhad befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which hadmodified his personal plans for the future, plans which were ratherindistinct in any case.Revery does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer fromtaking note of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying aboutin a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his somnambulism, atwo-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace andapparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet? Why was itdriving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sata young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag.The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in largeblack letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.This name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself up andhurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:--"Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!"The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.The young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised hiseyes:--"Hey?" said he."You are M. Marius Pontmercy?""Certainly.""I was looking for you," resumed Laigle de Meaux."How so?" demanded Marius; for it was he: in fact, he had just quittedhis grandfather's, and had before him a face which he now beheld for thefirst time. "I do not know you.""Neither do I know you," responded Laigle.Marius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of amystification in the open street. He was not in a very good humor at themoment. He frowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:--"You were not at the school day before yesterday.""That is possible.""That is certain.""You are a student?" demanded Marius."Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, bychance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor wasjust calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very ridiculouson such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name is erasedfrom the list. Sixty francs in the gulf."Marius began to listen."It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has avery pointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out theabsent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not beingcompromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No erasures;the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself:'Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of anexecution to-day.' All at once Blondeau calls, 'Marius Pontmercy!' Noone answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly: 'MariusPontmercy!' And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion.I said to myself hastily: 'Here's a brave fellow who is going to getscratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact.He's not a good student. Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student whostudies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, andsapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession.He is an honorable idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, whocultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is atthis very moment, perhaps, with my mistress. Let us save him. Death toBlondeau!' At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black witherasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, andrepeated for the third time: 'Marius Pontmercy!' I replied: 'Present!'This is why you were not crossed off.""Monsieur!--" said Marius."And why I was," added Laigle de Meaux."I do not understand you," said Marius.Laigle resumed:--"Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and closeto the door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with acertain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the maliciousnose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. Iam from Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.""L'Aigle!" interrupted Marius, "what fine name!""Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: 'Laigle!' Ireply: 'Present!' Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of atiger, and says to me: 'If you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.' Aphrase which has a disobliging air for you, but which was lugubriousonly for me. That said, he crossed me off."Marius exclaimed:--"I am mortified, sir--""First of all," interposed Laigle, "I demand permission to embalmBlondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume that heis dead. There will be no great change required in his gauntness, inhis pallor, in his coldness, and in his smell. And I say: 'Erudiminiqui judicatis terram. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, BlondeauNasica, the ox of discipline, bos disciplinae, the bloodhound of thepassword, the angel of the roll-call, who was upright, square exact,rigid, honest, and hideous. God crossed him off as he crossed me off.'"Marius resumed:--"I am very sorry--""Young man," said Laigle de Meaux, "let this serve you as a lesson. Infuture, be exact.""I really beg you a thousand pardons.""Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erasedagain.""I am extremely sorry--"Laigle burst out laughing."And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. Thiserasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defendthe widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no morestage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I amindebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call ofthanks upon you. Where do you live?""In this cab," said Marius."A sign of opulence," retorted Laigle calmly. "I congratulate you. Youhave there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum."At that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe.Marius smiled sadly."I have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get ridof it; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don't knowwhere to go.""Come to my place, sir," said Courfeyrac."I have the priority," observed Laigle, "but I have no home.""Hold your tongue, Bossuet," said Courfeyrac."Bossuet," said Marius, "but I thought that your name was Laigle.""De Meaux," replied Laigle; "by metaphor, Bossuet."Courfeyrac entered the cab."Coachman," said he, "hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques."And that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber ofthe hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.CHAPTER III--MARIUS' ASTONISHMENTSIn a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac's friend. Youth is theseason for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Mariusbreathed freely in Courfeyrac's society, a decidedly new thing for him.Courfeyrac put no questions to him. He did not even think of such athing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words aresuperfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that theircountenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows them.One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogationto him:--"By the way, have you any political opinions?""The idea!" said Marius, almost affronted by the question."What are you?""A democrat-Bonapartist.""The gray hue of a reassured rat," said Courfeyrac.On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Cafe Musain.Then he whispered in his ear, with a smile: "I must give you your entryto the revolution." And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A BC. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word whichMarius did not understand: "A pupil."Marius had fallen into a wasps'-nest of wits. However, although he wassilent and grave, he was, none the less, both winged and armed.Marius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and toasides, both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this coveyof young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited hisattention at once, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements ofthese minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes,in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty inrecovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, ofart, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpsesof strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in proper perspective,he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped. Onabandoning his grandfather's opinions for the opinions of his father,he had supposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, andwithout daring to avow it to himself, that he was not. The angleat which he saw everything began to be displaced anew. A certainoscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion. An oddinternal upsetting. He almost suffered from it.It seemed as though there were no "consecrated things" for those youngmen. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, whichembarrassed his still timid mind.A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedyfrom the ancient repertory called classic: "Down with tragedy dear tothe bourgeois!" cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:--"You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and thebourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy hasa reason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order ofAEschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines innature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is nota beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws whichare not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there isthe duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I donot see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antiquetragedy."Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseaubetween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.Courfeyrac took his arm:--"Pay attention. This is the Rue Platriere, now called Rue Jean-JacquesRousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixtyyears ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Therese. From timeto time, little beings were born there. Therese gave birth to them,Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings."And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:--"Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He deniedhis own children, that may be; but he adopted the people."Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor.Jean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said"Bonaparte." Enjolras pronounced it "Buonaparte."Marius was vaguely surprised. Initium sapientiae.CHAPTER IV--THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAINOne of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius waspresent and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to hismind.This took place in the back room of the Cafe Musain. Nearly all theFriends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp wassolemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passionand with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who heldtheir peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversationsbetween comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. Itwas a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed wordsto each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in allquarters.No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washerof the cafe, who passed through it from time to time, to go to herwashing in the "lavatory."Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he hadtaken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs,and shouting:--"I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has anattack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which willbe applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is ahideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and isworth nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. Life is a theatre set inwhich there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antiquereliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: 'All is vanity.'I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishingto go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching upof everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is aprofessor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecaryis a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, ajockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has aright and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro withhis glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher withhis rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What arecalled honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generallyof pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made ahorse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourselfup now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As forthe intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least.Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on whiteis ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would givethe dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomousthan the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwiseI would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance,I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead ofdaubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples;rapin[24] is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; as forthe rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at yourperfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every good quality tendstowards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is nextdoor to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; hewho says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vicesin virtue as there are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, theslain or the slayer, Caesar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of theslayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue,granted, but madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. TheBrutus who killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy.This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion,who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg,Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylionleft but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus wasin love with the one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing butwearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. Thebattle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis andthe Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water.I don't attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as toconquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! Ifyou are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering, whatwretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeyssuccess, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdainthe human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish meto begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it beGreece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion,as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent thatAnacephorus said of Pisistratus: "His urine attracts the bees." The mostprominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas,who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes withlead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the greatsquare in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny;this statue represented Episthates. What did Episthates do? He inventeda trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall Iadmire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris?I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because ofLondon? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, isthe headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year ofhunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add,as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath ofroses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admireJohn Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste forthat slave-holding brother. Take away Time is money, what remains ofEngland? Take away Cotton is king, what remains of America? Germany isthe lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia?Voltaire admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has itsbeauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots.Their health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter,a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivansstrangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basilspoisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russiais in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offerthis detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilizedwar, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from thebrigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the maraudingof the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. 'Bah!' you will say tome, 'but Europe is certainly better than Asia?' I admit that Asia is afarce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the GrandLama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions andyour elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirtychemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemenof the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels thatthe most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid themost chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, atConstantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there areall the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris,even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be arag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at thePiraeus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickersare called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and TheSlaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis,mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eatat Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to rollnaked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Goodday."Thus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, catchingat the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room ofthe Cafe Musain.Bossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence on him,and Grantaire began again worse than ever:--"Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect withyour gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes' bric-a-brac. I excuseyou from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wishme to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is asuccess, man is a failure. God made a mistake with that animal. Acrowd offers a choice of ugliness. The first comer is a wretch,Femme--woman--rhymes with infame,--infamous. Yes, I have the spleen,complicated with melancholy, with homesickness, plus hypochondria, andI am vexed and I rage, and I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired todeath, and I am stupid! Let God go to the devil!""Silence then, capital R!" resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a pointof law behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in aphrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:--"--And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, anamateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the termsof the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, anequivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, savingthe rights of others, and by all and several, the proprietors as wellas those seized with inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses, leases,freeholds, contracts of domain, mortgages--""Echo, plaintive nymph," hummed Grantaire.Near Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstandand a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville wasbeing sketched out.This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two headsat work touched each other: "Let us begin by finding names. When one hasthe names, one finds the subject.""That is true. Dictate. I will write.""Monsieur Dorimon.""An independent gentleman?""Of course.""His daughter, Celestine.""--tine. What next?""Colonel Sainval.""Sainval is stale. I should say Valsin."Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also takingadvantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An oldfellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, and explainingto him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with."The deuce! Look out for yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play isneat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, ajust parade, mathematical parries, bigre! and he is left-handed."In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes,and talking of love."You are in luck, that you are," Joly was saying. "You have a mistresswho is always laughing.""That is a fault of hers," returned Bahorel. "One's mistress does wrongto laugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see her gay removesyour remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience pricks you.""Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you neverquarrel!""That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our littleHoly Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, which we nevercross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on theside of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace.""Peace is happiness digesting.""And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement withMamselle--you know whom I mean?""She sulks at me with cruel patience.""Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.""Alas!""In your place, I would let her alone.""That is easy enough to say.""And to do. Is not her name Musichetta?""Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, withtiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled,with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.""My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant,and produce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers ofdouble-milled cloth at Staub's. That will assist.""At what price?" shouted Grantaire.The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. Paganmythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The question wasabout Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of pureromanticism.Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth,a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, and he was at once bothlaughing and lyric."Let us not insult the gods," said he. "The gods may not have takentheir departure. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods aredreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after theflight of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths.Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like theVignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it hasnot been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe intothe hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the holes in turn with hisfingers, and I have always believed that Io had something to do with thecascade of Pissevache."In the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which hadbeen granted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding itweakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the tablelay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac hadseized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments therattling of this sheet of paper."In the first place, I won't have any kings; if it were only from aneconomical point of view, I don't want any; a king is a parasite. Onedoes not have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. Atthe death of Francois I., the national debt of France amounted to anincome of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was twomilliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, whichwas equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, fivehundred millions, which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards.In the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted isbut a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to softenthe passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass insensiblyfrom the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutionalfictions,--what detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us neverenlighten the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and palein your constitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grantfrom the king to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14.By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatchesback. I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lielurks beneath it. A people which accepts a charter abdicates. The law isonly the law when entire. No! no charter!"It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. Thiswas tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poorTouquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paperflashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burnphilosophically, and contented himself with saying:--"The charter metamorphosed into flame."And sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called entrain,and that English thing which is called humor, good and bad taste,good and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue, mountingtogether and crossing from all points of the room, produced a sort ofmerry bombardment over their heads.CHAPTER V--ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZONThe shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirableproperty, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the lightningflash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. The burst of laughterstarts from a tender feeling.At the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend onthe first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest sufficesto open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations withabrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is thestage-manager of such conversations.A severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenlytraversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire,Bossuet, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing.How does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that itsuddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? Wehave just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of theuproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre,with this date:--"June 18th, 1815, Waterloo."At this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table,beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, andbegan to gaze fixedly at the audience."Pardieu!" exclaimed Courfeyrac ("Parbleu" was falling into disuseat this period), "that number 18 is strange and strikes me. It isBonaparte's fatal number. Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind, youhave the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity,that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement."Enjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence andaddressed this remark to Combeferre:--"You mean to say, the crime and the expiation."This word crime overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was alreadygreatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, could accept.He rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, andat whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, laid hisfinger on this compartment and said:--"Corsica, a little island which has rendered France very great."This was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt thatsomething was on the point of occurring.Bahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the torsoto which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen.Enjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to begazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:--"France needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she isFrance. Quia nomina leo."Marius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, and hisvoice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his verybeing:--"God forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleonwith her is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I ama new comer among you, but I will confess that you amaze me. Where do westand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come to an explanationabout the Emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the u like theRoyalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; hesays Buonaparte'. I thought you were young men. Where, then, is yourenthusiasm? And what are you doing with it? Whom do you admire, if youdo not admire the Emperor? And what more do you want? If you willhave none of that great man, what great men would you like? He hadeverything. He was complete. He had in his brain the sum of humanfaculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like Caesar, hisconversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with thethunderclap of Tacitus, he made history and he wrote it, his bulletinsare Iliads, he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor ofMahomet, he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids,at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences hereplied to Laplace, in the Council of State be held his own againstMerlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first, and to thechicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys and siderealwith the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, hewent to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saw everything;he knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughinggood-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once,frightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks ofartillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalrygalloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in everydirection, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the soundof a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; theybeheld him, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in hishand, and a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, his two wings,the grand army and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!"All held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence alwaysproduces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being drivento the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almostwithout pausing for breath:--"Let us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny for a nation to bethe Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when itadds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign,to march and to triumph, to have for halting-places all capitals, totake his grenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls ofdynasties, and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to makeyou feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of thesword of God; to follow in a single man, Hannibal, Caesar, Charlemagne;to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startlingannouncement of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides torouse you in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious wordswhich flame forever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram! To causeconstellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from thezenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant to theRoman Empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the grandarmy, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountainsends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strikewith lightning, to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory,to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquerthe world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and whatgreater thing is there?""To be free," said Combeferre.Marius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word hadtraversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt itvanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longerthere. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he hadjust taken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras,had followed him. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone withMarius, was gazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied hisideas to some extent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered inhim a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, oftranslating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when all ofa sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went. It wasCombeferre, and this is what he was singing:--               "Si Cesar m'avait donne[25]                 La gloire et la guerre,               Et qu'il me fallait quitter                 L'amour de ma mere,               Je dirais au grand Cesar:                 Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,               J'aime mieux ma mere, o gue!                 J'aime mieux ma mere!"The wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated tothis couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, andwith his eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: "Mymother?--"At that moment, he felt Enjolras' hand on his shoulder."Citizen," said Enjolras to him, "my mother is the Republic."CHAPTER VI--RES ANGUSTAThat evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy shadowin his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the momentwhen it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be depositedwithin it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joyof the fruit only arrive later.Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then rejectit already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared tohimself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite ofhimself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you havenot as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, isintolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Mariuswas clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubtpained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was,he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, toadvance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this leadhim? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought himnearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him fromthat father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections whichoccurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neitherwith his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes ofthe one, he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and herecognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age andon the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain.In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought ofcertain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allowthemselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius' room and saidto him:--"Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.""Yes.""But I must have my money.""Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me," said Marius.Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius thentold him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he wasthe same as alone in the world, and had no relatives."What is to become of you?" said Courfeyrac."I do not know in the least," replied Marius."What are you going to do?""I do not know.""Have you any money?""Fifteen francs.""Do you want me to lend you some?""Never.""Have you clothes?""Here is what I have.""Have you trinkets?""A watch.""Silver?""Gold; here it is.""I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair oftrousers.""That is good.""You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and acoat.""And my boots.""What! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!""That will be enough.""I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.""That is good.""No; it is not good. What will you do after that?""Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.""Do you know English?""No.""Do you know German?""No.""So much the worse.""Why?""Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of anencyclopaedia, for which you might have translated English or Germanarticles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.""I will learn English and German.""And in the meanwhile?""In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch."The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-offgarments. They went to the watchmaker's. He bought the watch forforty-five francs."That is not bad," said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to thehotel, "with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.""And the hotel bill?" observed Courfeyrac."Hello, I had forgotten that," said Marius.The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. Itamounted to seventy francs."I have ten francs left," said Marius."The deuce," exclaimed Courfeyrac, "you will eat up five francs whileyou are learning English, and five while learning German. That will beswallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly."In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person atbottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius' abode.One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letterfrom his aunt, and the sixty pistoles, that is to say, six hundredfrancs in gold, in a sealed box.Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter,in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and thathe should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment,he had three francs left.His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear ofexasperating him. Besides, had he not said: "Let me never hear the nameof that blood-drinker again!"Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish torun in debt there.BOOK FIFTH.--THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNECHAPTER I--MARIUS INDIGENT[Illustration: Excellence of Misfortune  3b5-1-misfortune]Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and hiswatch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de lavache enrage; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations.A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights withoutsleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks withoutwork, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat whichevokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on oneat night because one's rent is not paid, the insolence of the porterand the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignitytrampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness,despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such areoften the only things which one has to devour. At that moment of hisexistence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he feltthat he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculousbecause he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart withimperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidatedboots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes ofwretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emergebase, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into whichdestiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.For many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are instancesof bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step bystep in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes. Noble andmysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are requited with norenown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast. Life, misfortune,isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle which havetheir heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander than theheroes who win renown.Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always astep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might ofsoul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a goodmilk for the magnanimous.There came a moment in Marius' life, when he swept his own landing, whenhe bought his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer's, when hewaited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's and purchasea loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he hadstolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shopon the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, anawkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yetangry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stooddrops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher's astonishedwife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, wrappedit up in a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, and wentaway. It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself, helived for three days.On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on thethird he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, andsent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on everyoccasion, saying that he needed nothing.He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which wehave just described was effected within him. From that time forth, hehad not put off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him.The day came when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would go next.What was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done somegood turns, gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turnedby some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green.Then Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coatblack. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himselfwith the night.In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. He wassupposed to live in Courfeyrac's room, which was decent, and wherea certain number of law-books backed up and completed by severaldilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by theregulations. He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac's quarters.When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the factin a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect. M.Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in fourpieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or three days later,Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room,talking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever he was greatlyagitated. She listened, and the old man was saying: "If you were not afool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the sametime."CHAPTER II--MARIUS POORIt is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends bybecoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. Onevegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion,which is, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which theexistence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged:He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out alittle in front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, andwill, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs ayear. He had learned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who hadput him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filledthe modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishinghouse. He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotatededitions, compiled biographies, etc.; net product, year in and yearout, seven hundred francs. He lived on it. How? Not so badly. We willexplain.Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirtyfrancs, a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained onlythe most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belongedto him. He gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to comeand sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every morning,a fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll. Hisbreakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, according as eggswere dear or cheap. At six o'clock in the evening he descended theRue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau's, opposite Basset's, thestamp-dealer's, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup.He took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for threesous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread ashe wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the deskwhere Madam Rousseau, at that period still plump and rosy majesticallypresided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and Madam Rousseau gave him asmile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner.This Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water carafeswere emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. It nolonger exists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was calledRousseau the Aquatic.Thus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost him twentysous a day; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year. Addthe thirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman,plus a few trifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty francs, Mariuswas fed, lodged, and waited on. His clothing cost him a hundred francs,his linen fifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the whole did notexceed six hundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He sometimes lent tenfrancs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francsof him. As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had no fireplace, he had"simplified matters."Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, "for everyday"; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. Hehad but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, andthe third in the washerwoman's hands. He renewed them as they wore out.They were always ragged, which caused him to button his coat to thechin.It had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishingcondition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others toclimb. Marius had not failed for a single day. He had endured everythingin the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts.He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou.A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself,that a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses onlyyour person, a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer toit a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went without food. He hadpassed many a day fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, and that,if one is not on one's guard, lowered fortunes may lead to baseness ofsoul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Such and such a formalityor action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely adeference to him, now seemed insipidity, and he nerved himself againstit. His face wore a sort of severe flush. He was timid even to rudeness.During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and evenuplifted, at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself.The soul aids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is theonly bird which bears up its own cage.Besides his father's name, another name was graven in Marius' heart,the name of Thenardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature,surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts,he owed his father's life,--that intrepid sergeant who had saved thecolonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He neverseparated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, andhe associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in twosteps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one forThenardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towardsThenardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew thatThenardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius hadlearned at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunateinn-keeper. Since that time, he had made unheard-of efforts to findtraces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in whichThenardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole country; hehad gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He hadpersisted for three years, expending in these explorations the littlemoney which he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news ofThenardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditors had alsosought him, with less love than Marius, but with as much assiduity, andhad not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius blamed himself, andwas almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches.It was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius made it amatter of honor to pay it. "What," he thought, "when my father lay dyingon the field of battle, did Thenardier contrive to find him amid thesmoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, and yet heowed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Thenardier, cannot join himin this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in myturn bring him back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!" To findThenardier, in fact, Marius would have given one of his arms, to rescuehim from his misery, he would have sacrificed all his blood. To seeThenardier, to render Thenardier some service, to say to him: "You donot know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. Dispose of me!" This wasMarius' sweetest and most magnificent dream.CHAPTER III--MARIUS GROWN UPAt this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years sincehe had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the sameterms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking tosee each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other? Mariuswas the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. He hadimagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty,harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormedand brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only thataffection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy.Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children;there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom,as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him afterhis own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on theear; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart;he would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the whilesecretly regretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped thatthis Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, wouldreturn. But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand'sgreat despair, the "blood-drinker" did not make his appearance. "I couldnot do otherwise than turn him out," said the grandfather to himself,and he asked himself: "If the thing were to do over again, would I doit?" His pride instantly answered "yes," but his aged head, which heshook in silence, replied sadly "no." He had his hours of depression.He missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. It iswarmth. Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought somechange in him. Nothing in the world could have induced him to take astep towards "that rogue"; but he suffered. He never inquired about him,but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more andmore retired manner; he was still merry and violent as of old, buthis merriment had a convulsive harshness, and his violences alwaysterminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection. He sometimes said:"Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would givehim!"As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was nolonger for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventuallycame to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or theparoquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand'ssecret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, anddid not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like thoserecently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimeshappened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and askedhim: "What is your grandson doing?" "What has become of him?" The oldbourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving afillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: "Monsieur le Baron dePontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other."While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the casewith all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness.He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had sethis mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had beenunkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation of his firstindignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at sufferingstill. It was for his father's sake. The hardness of his life satisfiedand pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that--it wascertainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;--that, hadit not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way andlater on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such afather! that it would not have been just that his father should have allthe suffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were histoils and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life? that,in short, the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him,was to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other had been valiantbefore the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel hadmeant to imply by the words: "He will be worthy of it." Words whichMarius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel's writinghad disappeared, but in his heart.And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors,he had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, werepeat, had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, hasthis magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towardseffort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly laysmaterial life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible boundstowards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse andbrilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming,good repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser sideof the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides.The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he haseaten, he has nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacleswhich God furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars,flowers, children, the humanity among which he is suffering, thecreation amid which he beams. He gazes so much on humanity that heperceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent that hebeholds God. He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feelshimself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to thecompassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forthin him, forgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of theinnumerable enjoyments which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to soulswhich stand open, and refuses to souls that are closed, he comes topity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money. Allhatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light penetrates hisspirit. And is he unhappy? No. The misery of a young man is nevermiserable. The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he maybe, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes,his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his whiteteeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor.And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earninghis bread; and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal columngains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, he returns toineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet setin afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimesin the mire; his head in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle, peaceful,attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God forhaving bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a richman lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes himdignified.This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined alittle too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he hadsucceeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he hadstopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his workto give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire daysin meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mutevoluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propoundedthe problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at materiallabor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which isimpalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and tocast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, hedid not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becomingone of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself withconquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting fromhis labors too soon.It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, thiscould only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock againstthe inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever FatherGillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he wasnot even pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. Tohaunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases--what a bore! Whyshould he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining hislivelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had cometo mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too muchlabor, as we have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offeredto take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him withregular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To bewell lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his liberty!Be on fixed wages! A sort of hired man of letters! According to Marius'opinion, if he accepted, his position would become both better and worseat the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was afine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculousstate of torture: something like the case of a blind man who shouldrecover the sight of one eye. He refused.Marius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside ofeverything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not entereddecidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remainedgood friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in everypossible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends: one young,Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man.In the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had takenplace within him; to him he was indebted for having known and loved hisfather. "He operated on me for a cataract," he said.The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm andimpassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightenedMarius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candlewhich some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.As for Marius' inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totallyincapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.As we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will not besuperfluous.CHAPTER IV--M. MABEUFOn the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: "Certainly I approve ofpolitical opinions," he expressed the real state of his mind. Allpolitical opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approvedthem all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as theGreeks called the Furies "the beautiful, the good, the charming," theEumenides. M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted in a passionate lovefor plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world,he possessed the termination in ist, without which no one could exist atthat time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist,an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, a collector of oldbooks. He did not understand how men could busy themselves withhating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy,legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the worldall sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at,and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over. Hetook good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent hisreading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener. Whenhe made Pontmercy's acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between thecolonel and himself--that what the colonel did for flowers, he did forfruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savoryas the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations,apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no lessperfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He went to massrather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he loved thefaces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and silentonly in church. Feeling that he must be something in the State, he hadchosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in lovingany woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir.He had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: "Have younever been married?" "I have forgotten," said he. When it sometimeshappened to him--and to whom does it not happen?--to say: "Oh! if I wereonly rich!" it was not when ogling a pretty girl, as was the case withFather Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He lived alonewith an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when he was asleep,his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the foldsof his sheets. He had composed and published a Flora of the Environs ofCauteretz, with colored plates, a work which enjoyed a tolerablemeasure of esteem and which sold well. People rang his bell, in the RueMesieres, two or three times a day, to ask for it. He drew as much astwo thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole ofhis fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself,by dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection of rarecopies of every sort. He never went out without a book under his arm,and he often returned with two. The sole decoration of the four roomson the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framedherbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword ora gun chilled his blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life,even at the Invalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was acure, perfectly white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, atrembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air ofan old sheep, and he was easily frightened. Add to this, that he had noother friendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an oldbookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was tonaturalize indigo in France.His servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was aspinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri's miserere inthe Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantityof passion which existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceededas far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat. Likehim, she had a mustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which werealways white. She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in countingover the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dressesin the piece which she bought and never had made up. She knew how toread. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young andgentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combinedwith gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun withoutwind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder,with marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious battlesin which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of thesword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his herofrom the point of view of flowers.His brother the cure died about 1830, and almost immediately, as whenthe night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. Anotary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, whichwas all that he possessed in his brother's right and his own. TheRevolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period ofembarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a Flora. The Floraof the Environs of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed by without asingle purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell."Monsieur," said Mother Plutarque sadly, "it is the water-carrier."In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres, abdicated thefunctions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of hisbooks, but of his prints,--that to which he was the least attached,--andinstalled himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where,however, he remained but one quarter for two reasons: in the firstplace, the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs, and hedared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second,being near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots;which was intolerable to him.He carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, hisportfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpetriere,in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where,for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by ahedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of this removal to selloff nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his newquarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravingsand herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden therest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had amelancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulderand said to her with a smile: "We have the indigo!"Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius,were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawlingname which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in somebit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, arebut slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destinyis a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration apassivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemblephilosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away,and yet is hardly conscious of it one's self. It always ends, it istrue, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, itseems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going onbetween our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we lookon at the game with indifference.It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all hishopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained ratherpuerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regularswing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a verylong time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does notstop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensiveand unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, MotherPlutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She wasreading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud isto assure one's self of what one is reading. There are people who readvery loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their wordof honor as to what they are perusing.It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading theromance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening toher.In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. Itwas a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:--"--The beauty pouted, and the dragoon--"Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses."Bouddha and the Dragon," struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. "Yes, itis true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave,spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many starshad already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the clawsof a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting thedragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.There is no more beautiful legend in existence."And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious revery.CHAPTER V--POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERYMarius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling intothe clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, littleby little, without, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius metCourfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a monthat most.Marius' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outerboulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleysof the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a marketgarden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horseturning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, andsome of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He wasonly a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way.It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house,and, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abodethere. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.Some of his father's old generals or old comrades had invited him to goand see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused theirinvitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father.Thus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne,to General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing there.On such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went tothese evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold,because he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to arrivewith boots otherwise than like mirrors.He said sometimes, but without bitterness: "Men are so made that in adrawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In orderto insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is askedof you; your conscience? No, your boots."All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery. Marius'political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in theprocess, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, settingaside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they hadbeen tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any opinions, hehad sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity.Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people;out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all,that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, apoet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than an event likeMarengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, he returnedin the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse throughthe branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the namelessgleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is only humanseemed very petty indeed to him.He thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the truthof life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at nothingbut heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom ofher well.This did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations,his scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of revery,an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius' interior would havebeen dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given toour eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we shouldbe able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams,than according to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there isnone in dreams. Revery, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps,even in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothingproceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of oursoul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towardsthe splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than indeliberate, rational coordinated ideas, is the real character of a manto be found. Our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us.Each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordancewith his nature.Towards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on Mariustold him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had beenturned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his days outof the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors."Why are they turned out?" he asked."Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters.""How much is it?""Twenty francs," said the old woman.Marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer."Here," he said to the old woman, "take these twenty-five francs. Payfor the poor people and give them five francs, and do not tell them thatit was I."CHAPTER VI--THE SUBSTITUTEIt chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Theodule belonged cameto perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt Gillenormand witha second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan ofhaving Marius spied upon by Theodule; now she plotted to have Theoduletake Marius' place.At all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need ofa young face in the house,--these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet toruin,--it was expedient to find another Marius. "Take it as a simpleerratum," she thought, "such as one sees in books. For Marius, readTheodule."A grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyerone takes a lancer.One morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in theQuotidienne, his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice;for the question concerned her favorite:--"Father, Theodule is coming to present his respects to you thismorning.""Who's Theodule?""Your grandnephew.""Ah!" said the grandfather.Then he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew,who was merely some Theodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, whichalmost always happened when he read. The "sheet" which he held, althoughRoyalist, of course, announced for the following day, without anysoftening phrases, one of these little events which were of dailyoccurrence at that date in Paris: "That the students of the schoolsof law and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Pantheon, atmidday,--to deliberate." The discussion concerned one of the questionsof the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflictbetween the Minister of War and "the citizen's militia," on the subjectof the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students wereto "deliberate" over this. It did not take much more than this to swellM. Gillenormand's rage.He thought of Marius, who was a student, and who would probably go withthe rest, to "deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Pantheon."As he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Theodule enteredclad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, andwas discreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The lancer hadreasoned as follows: "The old druid has not sunk all his money in a lifepension. It is well to disguise one's self as a civilian from time totime."Mademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:--"Theodule, your grandnephew."And in a low voice to the lieutenant:--"Approve of everything."And she withdrew.The lieutenant, who was but little accustomed to such venerableencounters, stammered with some timidity: "Good day, uncle,"--and madea salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of themilitary salute finished off as a bourgeois salute."Ah! so it's you; that is well, sit down," said the old gentleman.That said, he totally forgot the lancer.Theodule seated himself, and M. Gillenormand rose.M. Gillenormand began to pace back and forth, his hands in his pockets,talking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the twowatches which he wore in his two fobs."That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Pantheon! by my life!urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to squeezetheir noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate to-morrow, atmidday. What are we coming to? What are we coming to? It is clear thatwe are making for the abyss. That is what the descamisados have broughtus to! To deliberate on the citizen artillery! To go and jabber in theopen air over the jibes of the National Guard! And with whom are they tomeet there? Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet anything youlike, a million against a counter, that there will be no one there butreturned convicts and released galley-slaves. The Republicans and thegalley-slaves,--they form but one nose and one handkerchief. Carnot usedto say: 'Where would you have me go, traitor?' Fouche replied: 'Whereveryou please, imbecile!' That's what the Republicans are like.""That is true," said Theodule.M. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Theodule, and went on:--"When one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro!Why did you leave my house? To go and become a Republican! Pssst! Inthe first place, the people want none of your republic, they have commonsense, they know well that there always have been kings, and that therealways will be; they know well that the people are only the people,after all, they make sport of it, of your republic--do you understand,idiot? Is it not a horrible caprice? To fall in love with Pere Duchesne,to make sheep's-eyes at the guillotine, to sing romances, and play onthe guitar under the balcony of '93--it's enough to make one spit on allthese young fellows, such fools are they! They are all alike. Not oneescapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through thestreet to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. Thefirst scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat's,thinks himself a real scoundrel, and abandons his old relatives. He'sa Republican, he's a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me thefavor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ranto Hernani. Now, I just ask you, Hernani! antitheses! abominationswhich are not even written in French! And then, they have cannons in thecourtyard of the Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!""You are right, uncle," said Theodule.M. Gillenormand resumed:--"Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you wantto fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridgesto do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day areall blackguards! What a pretty creature is their Benjamin Constant! Andthose who are not rascals are simpletons! They do all they can to makethemselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, inthe presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets thegirls into fits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the poorcreatures were ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they completethemselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin andPotier, they have sack coats, stablemen's waistcoats, shirts of coarselinen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and theirrigmarole resembles their plumage. One might make use of their jargonto put new soles on their old shoes. And all this awkward batch of bratshas political opinions, if you please. Political opinions should bestrictly forbidden. They fabricate systems, they recast society, theydemolish the monarchy, they fling all laws to the earth, they put theattic in the cellar's place and my porter in the place of the King, theyturn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, and all their loveaffairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses asthese women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you blackguard! togo and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to debate, to takemeasures! They call that measures, just God! Disorder humbles itselfand becomes silly. I have seen chaos, I now see a mess. Studentsdeliberating on the National Guard,--such a thing could not be seenamong the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! Savages who go naked, with theirnoddles dressed like a shuttlecock, with a club in their paws, are lessof brutes than those bachelors of arts! The four-penny monkeys! And theyset up for judges! Those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate! Theend of the world is come! This is plainly the end of this miserableterraqueous globe! A final hiccough was required, and France has emittedit. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen so long as they goand read the newspapers under the arcades of the Odeon. That costs thema sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and their heart andtheir soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from theirfamilies. All newspapers are pests; all, even the Drapeau Blanc! Atbottom, Martainville was a Jacobin. Ah! just Heaven! you may boast ofhaving driven your grandfather to despair, that you may!""That is evident," said Theodule.And profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, thelancer added in a magisterial manner:--"There should be no other newspaper than the Moniteur, and no other bookthan the Annuaire Militaire."M. Gillenormand continued:--"It is like their Sieyes! A regicide ending in a senator; for that isthe way they always end. They give themselves a scar with the addressof thou as citizens, in order to get themselves called, eventually,Monsieur le Comte. Monsieur le Comte as big as my arm, assassins ofSeptember. The philosopher Sieyes! I will do myself the justice to say,that I have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of allthose philosophers, than of the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli!One day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles ofviolet velvet sown with bees, with hats a la Henri IV. They werehideous. One would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger's court.Citizens, I declare to you, that your progress is madness, that yourhumanity is a dream, that your revolution is a crime, that your republicis a monster, that your young and virgin France comes from the brothel,and I maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether journalists,economists, legists, or even were you better judges of liberty, ofequality, and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine! And that Iannounce to you, my fine fellows!""Parbleu!" cried the lieutenant, "that is wonderfully true."M. Gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun, wheeled round,stared Lancer Theodule intently in the eyes, and said to him:--"You are a fool."BOOK SIXTH.--THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARSCHAPTER I--THE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMESMarius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature,with thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow,well-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity,and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent overhis whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded,without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness,which has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsaceand Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which renderedthe Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and whichdistinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that periodof life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equalparts, of depth and ingenuousness. A grave situation being given, hehad all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and hemight be sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, polished, not verygenial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeththe whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous smilepresented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his glance waslarge.At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that younggirls turned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death inhis soul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his oldclothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that theystared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by hadmade him shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason thathe fled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,--stupidly, asCourfeyrac said.Courfeyrac also said to him: "Do not aspire to be venerable" [theycalled each other thou; it is the tendency of youthful friendships toslip into this mode of address]. "Let me give you a piece of advice,my dear fellow. Don't read so many books, and look a little more at thelasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint offleeing and blushing, you will become brutalized."On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:--"Good morning,Monsieur l'Abbe!"When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Mariusavoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come,and he avoided Courfeyrac to boot.Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two womenwhom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. Intruth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informedthat they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out hischamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: "Seeing that his servant womanwears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard." The other was asort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of theLuxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pepiniere, a manand a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on thesame bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l'Ouestside. Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls ofpersons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,--and itwas nearly every day,--he found this couple there. The man appeared tobe about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole personpresented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who haveretired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would havesaid: "He is an ex-officer." He had a kindly but unapproachable air,and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He woreblue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which alwaysappeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, itwas dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A grisette who passed nearhim one day, said: "Here's a very tidy widower." His hair was verywhite.The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seatedherself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sortof child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almosthomely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise ofhandsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasingassurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of thescholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino.They had the air of being father and daughter.Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this littlegirl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid noattention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him.They conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girlchattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and,at times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. Heinvariably found them there.This is the way things went:--Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest fromtheir bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in frontof them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and beganagain. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade,and the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without itshaving occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. Thatpersonage, and that young girl, although they appeared,--and perhapsbecause they appeared,--to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused someattention on the part of the five or six students who strolled alongthe Pepiniere from time to time; the studious after their lectures,the others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among thelast, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, hehad speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, dischargingat them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely withthe child's gown and the old man's hair, he had dubbed the daughterMademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as noone knew them under any other title, this nickname became a law in thedefault of any other name. The students said: "Ah! Monsieur Leblanc ison his bench." And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient tocall this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order tofacilitate this tale.So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the firstyear. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.CHAPTER II--LUX FACTA ESTDuring the second year, precisely at the point in this history which thereader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg wasinterrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearlysix months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. Oneday, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summermorning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather isfine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of thebirds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which hecaught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.He went straight to "his alley," and when he reached the end of it heperceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, whenhe approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him thatit was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a talland beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of awoman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all themost ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, whichcan be expressed only by these two words,--"fifteen years." She hadwonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemedmade of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush,an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted likesunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have givento Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to aVenus. And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitchingface, her nose was not handsome--it was pretty; neither straight norcurved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that isto say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,--which drives painters todespair, and charms poets.When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which wereconstantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated withshadow and modesty.This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listenedto what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing couldbe more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those droopingeyes.For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the sameman, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit ofhis stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he hadexamined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six monthsthe little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is morefrequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom outin the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One leftthem children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to thefeelings.This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three daysin April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months hadsufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, passsuddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts,and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden. That isthe result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. Theyoung girl had received her quarterly income.And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, hermerino gown, her scholar's shoes, and red hands; taste had come to herwith beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of richand simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of blackdamask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Herwhite gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with thecarved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlinedthe smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toiletteexhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.As for the man, he was the same as usual.The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised hereyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiledazure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She lookedat Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat runningbeneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on thebench, and Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thoughtabout something else.He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times,but without even turning his eyes in her direction.On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg;as usual, he found there "the father and daughter;" but he paid nofurther attention to them. He thought no more about the girl now thatshe was beautiful than he had when she was homely. He passed very nearthe bench where she sat, because such was his habit.CHAPTER III--EFFECT OF THE SPRINGOne day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with lightand shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it thatmorning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depthsof the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature,he was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passednear the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glancesmet.What was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion? Marius couldnot have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was astrange flash.She dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of achild; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptlyclosed again.There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to himwho chances to be there!That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, islike the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiantand strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of thatunexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorableshadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, andof all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tendernesswhich reveals itself by chance, and which waits. It is a snare whichthe innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captureshearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking likea woman.It is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance,where it falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestialand fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances ofcoquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming,in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated withperfume and with poison, which is called love.That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes overhis garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been soslovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk inthe Luxembourg with his "every-day clothes," that is to say, with ahat battered near the band, coarse carter's boots, black trouserswhich showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at theelbows.CHAPTER IV--BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADYOn the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from hiswardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his newboots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, atremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to seehim. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:--"I have just met Marius' new hat and new coat, with Marius insidethem. He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterlystupid."On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountainbasin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time incontemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould,and one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeoisforty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by thehand a little urchin of five, and saying to him: "Shun excess, my son,keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy." Mariuslistened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin oncemore. At last he directed his course towards "his alley," slowly, and asif with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go thereand withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thoughtthat he was doing as he always did.On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at theother end, "on their bench." He buttoned his coat up to the very top,pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined,with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, andmarched on the bench. This march savored of an attack, and certainlyof a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as Ishould say: "Hannibal marched on Rome."However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he hadinterrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors.At that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du Baccalaureat wasa stupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, toallow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Moliere beinganalyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercingwhistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he heldfast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. Itseemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with avague blue light.In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. Onarriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he hadreached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himselfwhy he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he wouldnot go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the younggirl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fineappearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect,in case any one should be looking at him from behind.He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time heapproached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within threeintervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility ofproceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young girl'sface bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent effort,subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few seconds later,he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the veryears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to theleft, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman. At the momentwhen he passed,--under the cannon of the place,--he felt his heart beatwildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crapebonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been "her voice."She was talking tranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although hemade no attempt to see her. "She could not, however," he thought, "helpfeeling esteem and consideration for me, if she only knew that I amthe veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obregon de la Ronde,which M. Francois de Neufchateau put, as though it were his own, at thehead of his edition of Gil Blas." He went beyond the bench as far as theextremity of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel andpassed once more in front of the lovely girl. This time, he was verypale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went furtherfrom the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her,he fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near themiddle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down,and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit,that after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and blackgown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousersand his new coat.At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he wereon the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which wassurrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless.For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that thatgentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side,noticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence indesignating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquetof M. le Blanc.He stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figuresin the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M.Leblanc and his daughter, and went home.That day he forgot to dine. At eight o'clock in the evening he perceivedthis fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques,he said: "Never mind!" and ate a bit of bread.He did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up withgreat care.CHAPTER V--DIVRS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA'AM BOUGONOn the following day, Ma'am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the oldportress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma'amBougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have foundout, but this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,--Ma'am Bougonobserved, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going out again in hisnew coat.He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than hisbench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the precedingday, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the whitebonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stirfrom it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. Hedid not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded that theyhad quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l'Ouest. Later on,several weeks afterwards, when he came to think it over, he could neverrecall where he had dined that evening.On the following day, which was the third, Ma'am Bougon wasthunderstruck. Marius went out in his new coat. "Three days insuccession!" she exclaimed.She tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with immensestrides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois.She lost sight of him in two minutes, and returned breathless,three-quarters choked with asthma, and furious. "If there is any sense,"she growled, "in putting on one's best clothes every day, and makingpeople run like this!"Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg.The young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near ashe could, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off,then returned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hoursin watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and whoproduced on him the impression that they were making sport of him.A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for thesake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot,and that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir.He put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not showinghimself, and he began all over again on the morrow.She was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching acriticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction betweenher gaze, which was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gavea rather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweetcountenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming.CHAPTER VI--TAKEN PRISONEROn one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on hisbench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had notturned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An eventwas taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and hisdaughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken herfather's arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of thealley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again,then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was comingstraight towards him. "Ah! good Heavens!" thought he, "I shall not havetime to strike an attitude." Still the white-haired man and the girladvanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that itwas but a second. "What are they coming in this direction for?" he askedhimself. "What! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this sand, thiswalk, two paces from me?" He was utterly upset, he would have liked tobe very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross. He heard thesoft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He imagined thatM. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. "Is that gentleman going toaddress me?" he thought to himself. He dropped his head; when he raisedit again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as shepassed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensivesweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot. It seemed to himthat she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapsewithout coming as far as her, and that she was saying to him: "I amcoming myself." Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays andabysses.He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, howshe had looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he hadever seen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine andangelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing andDante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azureheavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was duston his boots.He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he startedup and walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possiblethat, at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamywhen he came near the children's nurses, that each one of them thoughthim in love with her.He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odeon, and said tohim: "Come and dine with me." They went off to Rousseau's and spentsix francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. Atdessert, he said to Courfeyrac. "Have you read the paper? What a finediscourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!"He was desperately in love.After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: "I will treat you to the play."They went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frederick in l'Auberge desAdrets. Marius was enormously amused.At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emergingfrom the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who wasstepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: "I should like toput that woman in my collection," almost horrified him.Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Cafe Voltaire on thefollowing morning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on thepreceding evening. He was very thoughtful and very merry. One wouldhave said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laughuproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces,who was presented to him. A circle of students formed round the table,and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which was utteredfrom the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell upon thefaults and omissions in Guicherat's dictionaries and grammars. Mariusinterrupted the discussion to exclaim: "But it is very agreeable, allthe same to have the cross!""That's queer!" whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire."No," responded Prouvaire, "that's serious."It was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent andcharming hour with which grand passions begin.A glance had wrought all this.When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing ismore simple. A glance is a spark.It was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was enteringthe unknown.The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which aretranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them everyday, peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything. Amoment arrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come,dream, speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all isover. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It hascaught you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thoughtwhich was fluttering loose, by some distraction which had attacked you.You are lost. The whole of you passes into it. A chain of mysteriousforces takes possession of you. You struggle in vain; no more humansuccor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, fromagony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune,your future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the powerof a wicked creature, or of a noble heart, you will not escape from thisterrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, or transfiguredby passion.CHAPTER VII--ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURESIsolation, detachment from everything, pride, independence, the tasteof nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life withinhimself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towardsall creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is calledpassion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion,and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul.Something was required in the foreground. Love came.A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to theLuxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.--"Heis on duty," said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It iscertain that the young girl did look at him.He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did notpass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidityand to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered itbetter not to attract "the attention of the father." He combined hisstations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with aprofound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by theyoung girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, heremained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidasor a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gentlyraised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned hercharming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in themost natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man,she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye.Ancient and time-honored manoeuvre which Eve understood from the veryfirst day of the world, and which every woman understands from the veryfirst day of her life! her mouth replied to one, and her glance repliedto another.It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, foroften, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He hadabandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by theGladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the objectof seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did notunderstand, and committed this error. "The father" began to growinexact, and no longer brought "his daughter" every day. Sometimes, hecame alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, hehad passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.His love increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, anunexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling ofthe shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, onthe bench which "M. Leblanc and his daughter" had just quitted, ahandkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white,and fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume. He seizedit with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F.Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,--neither her familyname, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the firstthing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, uponwhich he immediately began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidentlythe Christian name. "Ursule!" he thought, "what a delicious name!" Hekissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on his heart, on hisflesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips that hemight fall asleep on it."I feel that her whole soul lies within it!" he exclaimed.This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let itfall from his pocket.In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he onlydisplayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing thehandkerchief and laying it on his heart. The beautiful child understoodnothing of all this, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs."O modesty!" said Marius.CHAPTER VIII--THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPYSince we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing,we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, "hisUrsule" caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days whenshe persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk.A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of theplaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passedMarius' bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and wasfollowing them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situationof his soul.All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probablycharged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down fromthe nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl ina delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the fawns ofTheocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that ofIsis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shapeappeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinelytroubled motion, but he was none the less angry for all that. He wasalone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some onethere. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehendsuch a thing? What she had just done is horrible!--Alas, the poor childhad done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius,in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined tobe vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, thatthe harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the humanheart, and takes possession of it, even without any right. Moreover,setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg hadcontained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the firstwoman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.When "his Ursule," after having reached the end of the walk, retracedher steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on whichMarius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen andferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slightstraightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising ofthe eyelids, which signifies: "Well, what is the matter?"This was "their first quarrel."Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some onecrossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled,and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breastthe little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, thesoldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with acoat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a woodenleg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely wellsatisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbledalong past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink,as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and asthough they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did thatrelic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed betweenthat wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm ofjealousy.--"Perhaps he was there!" he said to himself; "perhaps hesaw!"--And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius' wrath against"Ursule," just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally pardonedher; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three days.Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passionaugmented and grew to madness.CHAPTER IX--ECLIPSEThe reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that hediscovered, that She was named Ursule.Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a greatdeal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had devouredthis bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived.He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of thebench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining atthe Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed athird, and an immense one. He followed "Ursule."She lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in anew, three-story house, of modest appearance.From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her atthe Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.His hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charmingname, a genuine woman's name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to knowwho she was.One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seenthem disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train andsaid boldly to the porter:--"Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just comein?""No," replied the porter. "He is the gentleman on the third floor."Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius."On the front?" he asked."Parbleu!" said the porter, "the house is only built on the street.""And what is that gentleman's business?" began Marius again."He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good tothe unfortunate, though not rich himself.""What is his name?" resumed Marius.The porter raised his head and said:--"Are you a police spy, sir?"Marius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on."Good," thought he, "I know that her name is Ursule, that she is thedaughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she livesthere, on the third floor, in the Rue de l'Ouest."On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a verybrief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broaddaylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest, as he had taken upthe habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc madehis daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold,and stared intently at Marius.On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited forthem all day in vain.At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l'Ouest, and saw a light in thewindows of the third story.He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then wentand did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to teno'clock in the evening.His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and lovethe lover.He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at theLuxembourg.Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the portecochere during the day; he contented himself with going at night to gazeupon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit acrossthem, and his heart began to beat.On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no lightin them."Hello!" he said, "the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can theyhave gone out?" He waited until ten o'clock. Until midnight. Until onein the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story,and no one entered the house.He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.On the morrow,--for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was,so to speak, no to-day for him,--on the morrow, he found no one at theLuxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor wastotally dark.Marius rapped at the porte cochere, entered, and said to the porter:--"The gentleman on the third floor?""Has moved away," replied the porter.Marius reeled and said feebly:--"How long ago?""Yesterday.""Where is he living now?""I don't know anything about it.""So he has not left his new address?""No."And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius."Come! So it's you!" said he; "but you are decidedly a spy then?"BOOK SEVENTH.--PATRON MINETTECHAPTER I--MINES AND MINERSHuman societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, a thirdlower floor. The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes forgood, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other.There are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and abottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneathcivilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample underfoot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that wasalmost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitiveChristianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosionunder the Caesars and to inundate the human race with light. For in thesacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadowthat is capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night. Thecatacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellarof Rome, they were the vaults of the world.Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure,there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, thephilosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such andsuch a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such anotherwith wrath. People hail and answer each other from one catacomb toanother. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There theybranch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and fraternizethere. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him hislantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes Sociniusby the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all theseenergies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, whichgoes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities,and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and thebottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly even suspects thisdigging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels. Thereare as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works,as there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations? Thefuture.The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The workis good, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able torecognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down,it becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longerpenetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by manhas been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of thisladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, andwhere one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimesmisshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there isDescartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, thereis Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre,there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lowerdown, confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct from theinvisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist asyet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are forms.The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonicwork of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.A world in limbo, in the state of foetus, what an unheard-of spectre!Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves,binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, thinkthemselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, andthe light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first areparadisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be thecontrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal,from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and thisis it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. Theythrow themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not ofthemselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. Thefirst has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though hemay be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite.Venerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign--the starry eye.The shadowy eye is the other sign.With it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any onewho has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where lightbecomes extinct.Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all thesegalleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system ofprogress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower thanMarat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connectionwith the upper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot. Thisis what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous. It is the graveof shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. Inferi.This communicates with the abyss.CHAPTER II--THE LOWEST DEPTHSThere disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; eachone is for himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, andgnaws. The social Ugolino is in this gulf.The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almostphantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorantboth of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anythingbut the satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almostunconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terribleobliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance andmisery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction,appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ferocious, notafter the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger.From suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzycreation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in the social third lowerlevel is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protestof matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty--thatis the point of departure; to be Satan--that is the point reached. Fromthat vault Lacenaire emerges.We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of theupper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophicalexcavation. There, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified,honest. There, assuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy ofveneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work thereeffected, taken as a whole has a name: Progress.The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths,hideous depths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this point,and there will exist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated,the great cavern of evil.This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, withoutexception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cuta pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of theinkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath thisstifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper.Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; Marat is an aristocrat toSchinderhannes. This cavern has for its object the destruction ofeverything.Of everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates.It not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual socialorder; it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, itundermines civilization, it undermines revolution, it underminesprogress. Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination.It is darkness, and it desires chaos. Its vault is formed of ignorance.All the others, those above it, have but one object--to suppress it.It is to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all theirorgans simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, as well as bytheir contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern Ignorance andyou destroy the lair Crime.Let us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written.The only social peril is darkness.Humanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. There is nodifference, here below, at least, in predestination. The same shadowin front, the same flesh in the present, the same ashes afterwards. Butignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurableblackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is thereconverted into evil.CHAPTER III--BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSEA quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnassegoverned the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had thesewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscleswere of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern,his torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought onebeheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvetwaistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might havesubdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one. A lowbrow, large temples, less than forty years of age, but with crow's-feet,harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like that of a wildboar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles called forwork, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great, idle force.He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a creole. Hehad, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porterat Avignon in 1815. After this stage, he had turned ruffian.The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer.Babet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable.Daylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. Hedeclared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He hadplayed in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a finetalker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. Hisoccupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts andportraits of "the head of the State." In addition to this, he extractedteeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a boothwith a trumpet and this poster: "Babet, Dental Artist, Member of theAcademies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extractsteeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price:one tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; threeteeth, two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity." This Takeadvantage of this opportunity meant: Have as many teeth extracted aspossible. He had been married and had had children. He did not know whathad become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses hishandkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the worldto which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family withhim in his booth on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a womanhad just given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf'smuzzle, and he exclaimed: "There's a fortune! my wife has not the wit topresent me with a child like that!"Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to "undertake Paris."This was his expression.Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubedwith black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from thehole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No oneknew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness,and with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainlynot. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.Babet said: "Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices." Claquesous wasvague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name,Claquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as hisstomach spoke more frequently than his voice; no one was sure that hehad a face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared asthough he had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as thoughhe sprang from the earth.A lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less thantwenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charmingblack hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had allvices and aspired to all crimes.The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was thestreet boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He wasgenteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim ofhis hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a tuftof hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with violence.His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was afashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders. Thecause of all this youth's crimes was the desire to be well-dressed. Thefirst grisette who had said to him: "You are handsome!" had cast thestain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel.Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, theheight of elegance is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Fewprowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had alreadynumerous corpses in his past. More than one passer-by lay withoutstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, with his face in apool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman,the bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from theboulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeonin his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of thesepulchre.CHAPTER IV--COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPEThese four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpentamong the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet glances"under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain," lending each other theirnames and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes withsecret compartments and refuges for each other, stripping off theirpersonalities, as one removes his false nose at a masked ball, sometimessimplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual,sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latourhimself took them for a whole throng.These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robberwith four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were thatmonstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying theirrelations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were chargedwith the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department ofthe Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnalimaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. Theyfurnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook thepreparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They werealways in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable toall crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which weresufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, theyunder-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadowsat the disposition of all underground tragedies.They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when theywoke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere. There they heldtheir conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; theyregulated their employment accordingly.Patron-Minette,--such was the name which was bestowed in thesubterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In thefantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day,Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien etloup--between dog and wolf--signifies the evening. This appellation,Patron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their workended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for theseparation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title.When the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, andquestioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, "Who didit?" demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, enigmaticalso far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police:"Perhaps it was Patron-Minette."A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages;in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffianscomposing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal membersof Patron-Minette answered,--for the names have survived in specialmemoirs.Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.Brujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain frominterpolating this word.]Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.Laveuve.Finistere.Homere-Hogu, a negro.Mardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)Depeche. (Make haste.)Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl).Glorieux, a discharged convict.Barrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.L'Esplanade-du-Sud.Poussagrive.Carmagnolet.Kruideniers, called Bizarro.Mangedentelle. (Lace-eater.)Les-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.Etc., etc.We pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have facesattached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one ofthese names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from theunder side of civilization.Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were notamong the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by thewild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimesin the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre orMontrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.What became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed.Horace speaks of them: Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae, mendici,mimae; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain whatthey are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continuallyborn again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but alwaysidentical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they areno longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribesubsists.They always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, therace is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, theyscent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them.There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that theyhave a "stealable" air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. Theyexperience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of aman from the country.These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpseof them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seemto be men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that theyhabitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are inno wise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than thedarkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of livingfor a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from thenight.What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light infloods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society frombelow.BOOK EIGHTH.--THE WICKED POOR MANCHAPTER I--MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MAN INA CAPSummer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor theyoung girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth,Marius had but one thought,--to gaze once more on that sweet andadorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; he foundnothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm,resolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erectedfuture on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with projects,with pride, with ideas and wishes; he was a lost dog. He fell into ablack melancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, walking tired him.Vast nature, formerly so filled with forms, lights, voices, counsels,perspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay empty before him. It seemedto him that everything had disappeared.He thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longertook pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to himin a whisper, he replied in his darkness: "What is the use?"He heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. "Why did I follow her? Iwas so happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not thatimmense? She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wishedto have, what? There was nothing after that. I have been absurd. It ismy own fault," etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,--itwas his nature,--but who made some little guess at everything,--that washis nature,--had begun by congratulating him on being in love, though hewas amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state,he ended by saying to him: "I see that you have been simply an animal.Here, come to the Chaumiere."Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowedhimself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, andGrantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there.Of course he did not see the one he sought.--"But this is the place,all the same, where all lost women are found," grumbled Grantaire in anaside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot,alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes,stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singingcreatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close tohim, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of thewalnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.He took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly givenup to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf inthe trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him asingular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of theBoulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing acap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of verywhite hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, andscrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed inpainful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M.Leblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cappermitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But whythese workingman's clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signifiedthat disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself,his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did nothold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see theman near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to himtoo late, the man was no longer there. He had turned into some littleside street, and Marius could not find him. This encounter occupiedhis mind for three days and then was effaced. "After all," he said tohimself, "it was probably only a resemblance."CHAPTER II--TREASURE TROVEMarius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any onethere.At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in thehouse, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid,without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, ordaughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had beenturned out in default of payment.One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in theafternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemasday whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks' cold spell,inspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with justiceremained classic:--           Qu'il luise ou qu'il luiserne,           L'ours rentre dans en sa caverne.[26]Marius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour forhis dinner; for he had been obliged to take to dining again, alas! oh,infirmities of ideal passions!He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma'am Bougon was sweeping atthe moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:--"What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothingin the world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing,the trouble of the world!"Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order toreach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round,and saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other alittle shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in terror,and with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him,had not seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through thetwilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild heads,their dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats,and their bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The taller said in avery low voice:--"The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle."The other answered: "I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!"Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or thepolice had come near apprehending these two children, and that thelatter had escaped.They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and therecreated, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot,then disappeared.Marius had halted for a moment.He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little grayishpackage lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. Itwas a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers."Good," he said to himself, "those unhappy girls dropped it."He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflectedthat they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, andwent off to dine.On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child's coffin,covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by acandle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind."Poor mothers!" he thought. "There is one thing sadder than to see one'schildren die; it is to see them leading an evil life."Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from histhoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations.He fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happinessin the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees ofLuxembourg."How gloomy my life has become!" he said to himself. "Young girls arealways appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they areghouls."CHAPTER III--QUADRIFRONSThat evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, his handcame in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which hehad picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that itwould be well to open it, and that this package might possibly containthe address of the young girls, if it really belonged to them, and, inany case, the information necessary to a restitution to the person whohad lost it.He opened the envelope.It was not sealed and contained four letters, also unsealed.They bore addresses.All four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco.The first was addressed: "To Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray,the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.--"Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it theinformation which he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open,it was probable that it could be read without impropriety.It was conceived as follows:--Madame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency and piety is that which mostclosely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look ofcompassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachmentto the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood,consecrated his fortune, evverything, to defend that cause, and to-dayfinds himself in the greatest missery. He doubts not that your honorableperson will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful fora military man of education and honor full of wounds, counts in advanceon the humanity which animates you and on the interest which Madame laMarquise bears to a nation so unfortunate. Their prayer will not be invain, and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir. My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be                            Madame,                                 Don Alvares, Spanish Captain                                 of Cavalry, a royalist who                                 has take refuge in France,                                 who finds himself on travells                                 for his country, and the                                 resources are lacking him to                                 continue his travells.No address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find the addressin the second letter, whose superscription read: A Madame, Madame laComtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9. This is what Marius read init:-- Madame la Comtesse:  It is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old.  I sick since my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago, haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance. In the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be, Madame, with profound respect,                                        Mistress Balizard.Marius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like thepreceding; he read:--        Monsieur Pabourgeot, Elector, wholesale stocking merchant,           Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers. I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the Theatre-Francais. The subject is historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have some merit.  There are couplets to be sung in four places.  The comic, the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters, and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations, in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes. My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion, that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind. In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which new-comers are treated. Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire in this wynter season.  When I say to you that I beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection, and of adorning my writings with your name.  If you deign to honor me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude. Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible, will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage.                             To Monsieur                                and Madame Pabourgeot,                                   My most respectful complements,                                      Genflot, man of letters.       P. S. Even if it is only forty sous. Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself, but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me, alas! to go out.Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: To thebenevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-haut-Pas. Itcontained the following lines:-- Benevolent Man:  If you deign to accompany my daughter, you will behold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates. At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers always feel lively emotions. Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved.  Destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others. I await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one, and I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I have the honor to be,                       truly magnanimous man,                         your very humble                           and very obedient servant,                                        P. Fabantou, dramatic artist.After perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself muchfurther advanced than before.In the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alveras,Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; butthe singular thing about these letters was, that all four were writtenby the same hand.What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all comefrom the same person?Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, thecoarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobaccowas the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary thestyle, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatesttranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt fromthem than the Spanish captain.It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it notbeen a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification.Marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and tolend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirousof playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part ofthe blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, and thatthey were making sport of him.Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the twoyoung girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they wereevidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope,flung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o'clock inthe morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to settledown to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.As he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally,though very rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even whenabsent he left his key in the lock. "You will be robbed," said Ma'amBougon. "Of what?" said Marius. The truth is, however, that he had, oneday, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph of Ma'amBougon.There came a second knock, as gentle as the first."Come in," said Marius.The door opened."What do you want, Ma'am Bougon?" asked Marius, without raising his eyesfrom the books and manuscripts on his table.A voice which did not belong to Ma'am Bougon replied:--"Excuse me, sir--"It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man,roughened with brandy and liquor.Marius turned round hastily, and beheld a young girl.CHAPTER IV--A ROSE IN MISERY[Illustration: Rose in Misery  3b8-4-rose-in-misery]A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer windowof the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely oppositethe door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail,emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and apetticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was astring, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from herchemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, redhands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, baseeyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and thelook of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one ofthose beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause thoseto shudder whom they do not cause to weep.Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, whowas almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had notcome into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must evenhave been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against thehideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains ofbeauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlightwhich is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day.That face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he rememberedhaving seen it somewhere."What do you wish, Mademoiselle?" he asked.The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:--"Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius."She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the personwhom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his name?Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She enteredresolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed,at the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holesin her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees.She was shivering.She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer whichsealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from adistance. He read:-- My amiable neighbor, young man:  I have learned of your goodness to me, that you paid my rent six months ago.  I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill.  If I am not deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor. I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity,-- Jondrette. P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure whichhad occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was likea candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was thesame writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, thesame odor of tobacco.There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a singlesigner. The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all fournamed Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had,as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpseof, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where themind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once topass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mereforms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the precedingevening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, withoutrecognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with greatdifficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened inhim, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having mether elsewhere.Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighborJondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on thecharity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that hewrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy andcompassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their riskand peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked hisdaughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as thestake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on theevening before, from their breathless condition, from their terrorand from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunatecreatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that theresult of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is nowconstituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, aspecies of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good norevil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood,have already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, norresponsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are fadedto-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiledwith every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, theyoung girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacityof a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as to hernakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fellalmost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged thetoilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes,she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners."Hullo!" said she, "you have a mirror!"And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone,frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice renderedlugubrious.An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptiblebeneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightenedby the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under otherconditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of thisyoung girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never, even amonganimals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. Thatis only to be seen among men.Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.She approached the table."Ah!" said she, "books!"A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressedthe happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no humancreature is insensible:--"I know how to read, I do!"She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read withtolerable fluency:--"--General Bauduin received orders to take the chateau of Hougomontwhich stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with fivebattalions of his brigade."She paused."Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My fatherwas there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartistsin our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English."She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:--"And I know how to write, too!"She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:--"Do you want to see? Look here, I'm going to write a word to show you."And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper,which lay in the middle of the table: "The bobbies are here."Then throwing down the pen:--"There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received aneducation, my sister and I. We have not always been as we are now. Wewere not made--"Here she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing,saying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish,stifled by every form of cynicism:--"Bah!"And she began to hum these words to a gay air:--      "J'ai faim, mon pere."      I am hungry, father.       Pas de fricot.             I have no food.       J'ai froid, ma mere.       I am cold, mother.       Pas de tricot.             I have no clothes.       Grelotte,                  Lolotte!            Lolotte!                   Shiver,            Sanglote,                  Sob,            Jacquot!"                  Jacquot!"She had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:--"Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a littlebrother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me ticketssometimes. But I don't like the benches in the galleries. One is crampedand uncomfortable there. There are rough people there sometimes; andpeople who smell bad."Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:--"Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?"And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and madeher smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on hisshoulder: "You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet youhere on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person namedFather Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when Ihave been strolling in that quarter. It is very becoming to you to haveyour hair tumbled thus."She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it verydeep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx toher lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.Marius had retreated gently."Mademoiselle," said he, with his cool gravity, "I have here a packagewhich belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you."And he held out the envelope containing the four letters.She clapped her hands and exclaimed:--"We have been looking everywhere for that!"Then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying asshe did so:--"Dieu de Dieu! how my sister and I have hunted! And it was you who foundit! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the boulevard?You see, we let it fall when we were running. It was that brat of asister of mine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could not find itanywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is useless, as thatis entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we said that we hadcarried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us:'Nix.' So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find outthat they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that wejostled as we passed last night. We couldn't see. I said to my sister:'Is it a gentleman?' My sister said to me: 'I think it is a gentleman.'"In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to "thebenevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas.""Here!" said she, "this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By theway, this is his hour. I'll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will giveus something to breakfast on."Then she began to laugh again, and added:--"Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will meanthat we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday, ourbreakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once, andthis morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs, burst!"This reminded Marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself. Hefumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.The young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius'presence."I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don't come home again. Lastwinter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges.We huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. Howmelancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I saidto myself: 'No, it's too cold.' I go out alone, whenever I choose, Isometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk alongthe boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black andas big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I sayto myself: 'Why, there's water there!' The stars are like the lamps inilluminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blewthem out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears;although it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and Idon't know what all. I think people are flinging stones at me, I fleewithout knowing whither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel veryqueer when you have had no food."And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.By dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finallycollected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the worldfor the moment. "At all events," he thought, "there is my dinner forto-day, and to-morrow we will see." He kept the sixteen sous, and handedthe five francs to the young girl.She seized the coin."Good!" said she, "the sun is shining!"And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting theavalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:--"Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain't this fine!You're a jolly thief! I'm your humble servant! Bravo for the goodfellows! Two days' wine! and meat! and stew! we'll have a royal feast!and a good fill!"She pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius,then a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:--"Good morning, sir. It's all right. I'll go and find my old man."As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode,which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it andbit into it, muttering:--"That's good! it's hard! it breaks my teeth!"Then she departed.CHAPTER V--A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLEMarius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even indistress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. Truemisery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had justpassed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery ofman has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he whohas seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see themisery of the child.When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his lastresources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surroundhim! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail himsimultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the morallight within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of thewoman and the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragilepartitions which all open on either vice or crime.Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, theheart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulatedin sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, whichencounters opprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers,mothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhereand become incorporated, almost like a mineral formation, in that duskypromiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, and innocences.They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They exchangewoe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! Howcold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much furtherfrom the sun than ours.This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sadshadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery andpassion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors upto that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement,which any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have donebetter than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandonedbeings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest ofthe world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, thelast link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, orrather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed tothem! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other sideof the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not evenlend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listento them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossibleradiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, humancreatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people,were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of theirmisfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighborwho was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitableman, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals ofdistress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken holdof and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, nodoubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becomingdegraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate andthe infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word,the miserable; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity beall the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions onwhich Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue andscolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall whichseparated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make hisgaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretchedpeople. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams,and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices andwords to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius couldhave failed to perceive this long before. There was no paper pasted onthe wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; thecoarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined thepartition, almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes,and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had justperceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, whichresulted from the space between three lathes. The plaster which shouldhave filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode,a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes' attic.Commiseration has, and should have, its curiosity. This aperture formeda sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze at misfortune like atraitor in order to succor it.[27]"Let us get some little idea of what these people are like," thoughtMarius, "and in what condition they are."He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.CHAPTER VI--THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIRCities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wickedand formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only,in cities, that which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, andpetty, that is to say, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself isferocious, savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lairwith another, the beast's is preferable to the man's. Caverns are betterthan hovels.What Marius now beheld was a hovel.Marius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as hispoverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye nowrested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The onlyfurniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits ofcrockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; allthe light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped withspiders' webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough lightto make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The wallshad a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like avisage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exudedfrom them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could bedistinguished upon them.The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; thisone was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directlyon the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under thelong-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirtseemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but one virginity,that of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of oldshoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this room had a fireplace,so it was let for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thingin that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags suspendedfrom nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire. Two brands weresmouldering there in a melancholy way.One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, thatit was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lowersides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomablenooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one's fist, wood-liceas large as one's foot, and perhaps even--who knows?--some monstroushuman beings, must be hiding.One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. Oneend of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near theaperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a blackframe was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in largeletters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented a sleepingwoman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman's lap, an eaglein a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting thecrown away from the child's head, without awaking the latter; in thebackground, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue column with ayellow capital ornamented with this inscription:                            MARINGO                           AUSTERLITS                              IENA                            WAGRAMME                              ELOTBeneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than itwas broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude againstthe wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned tothe wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of somepier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waitingto be rehung.Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sata man about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with acunning, cruel, and uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.If Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulturemingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifoggerrendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; thepettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making thepettifogger horrible.This man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman's chemise, whichallowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair,to be seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through whichhis toes projected were visible.He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in thehovel, but there was still tobacco.He was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius hadread.On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume,and the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed aromance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in largecapitals: GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; BY DUCRAY DUMINIL, 1814.As the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:--"The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just lookat Pere Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in theacacia alley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. Thelittle people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are putdown below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. Theyare put there so that they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to seethem without sinking into the earth."He paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground histeeth:--"Oh! I could eat the whole world!"A big woman, who might be forty years of age, or a hundred, wascrouching near the fireplace on her bare heels.She, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patchedwith bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of herpetticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, itcould be seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort ofgiant, beside her husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blondwhich was turning gray, and which she thrust back from time to time,with her enormous shining hands, with their flat nails.Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as theother, and probably a volume of the same romance.On one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall paleyoung girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who didnot seem to be listening or seeing or living.No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.She seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny itwas evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who hadsaid, on the boulevard the evening before: "I bolted, bolted, bolted!"She was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time,then suddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces thesemelancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood noryouth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen theyseem twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might saythat they stride through life, in order to get through with it the morespeedily.At this moment, this being had the air of a child.Moreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; no handicraft,no spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some ironmongery ofdubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows despair andprecedes the death agony.Marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying thanthe interior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt flutteringthere, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the lowlyditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of thesocial edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its antechamber;but, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entranceof their palaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side byside with them, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule.The man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl didnot even seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper wasaudible.The man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. "Canaille! canaille!everybody is canaille!"This variation to Solomon's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman."Calm yourself, my little friend," she said. "Don't hurt yourself, mydear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband."Bodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts drawapart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judgingfrom the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily andreciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on thewhole group, this had become extinct. There no longer existed in heranything more than the ashes of affection for her husband. Nevertheless,caressing appellations had survived, as is often the case. She calledhim: My dear, my little friend, my good man, etc., with her mouth whileher heart was silent.The man resumed his writing.CHAPTER VII--STRATEGY AND TACTICSMarius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descendingfrom the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a soundattracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post.The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl madeher appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse,men's shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her redankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters.Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had probablydeposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the more pity,and had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door tobehind her, paused to take breath, for she was completely breathless,then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:--"He is coming!"The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, thelittle sister did not stir."Who?" demanded her father."The gentleman!""The philanthropist?""Yes.""From the church of Saint-Jacques?""Yes.""That old fellow?""Yes.""And he is coming?""He is following me.""You are sure?""I am sure.""There, truly, he is coming?""He is coming in a fiacre.""In a fiacre. He is Rothschild."The father rose."How are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that youarrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell himthat it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? Ifhe only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did heread my letter? What did he say to you?""Ta, ta, ta," said the girl, "how you do gallop on, my good man! Seehere: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him areverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me:'Where do you live, my child?' I said: 'Monsieur, I will show you.' Hesaid to me: 'No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases tomake, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time thatyou do.' I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemedsurprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: 'Never mind, Iwill come.' When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the churchwith his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tellhim the last door in the corridor, on the right.""And what makes you think that he will come?""I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That iswhat made me run so.""How do you know that it was the same fiacre?""Because I took notice of the number, so there!""What was the number?""440.""Good, you are a clever girl."The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which shehad on her feet:--"A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won't put these shoes onagain, and that I won't, for the sake of my health, in the first place,and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don't know anythingmore irritating than shoes that squelch, and go ghi, ghi, ghi, the wholetime. I prefer to go barefoot.""You are right," said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted withthe young girl's rudeness, "but then, you will not be allowed to enterchurches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot gobarefoot to the good God," he added bitterly.Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:--"So you are sure that he will come?""He is following on my heels," said she.The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance."Wife!" he exclaimed, "you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguishthe fire."The stupefied mother did not stir.The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jugwhich stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.Then, addressing his eldest daughter:--"Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!"His daughter did not understand.He seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His legpassed through it.As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:--"Is it cold?""Very cold. It is snowing."The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near thewindow, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:--"Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything?Break a pane of glass!"The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver."Break a pane!" he repeated.The child stood still in bewilderment."Do you hear me?" repeated her father, "I tell you to break a pane!"The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, andstruck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loudclatter."Good," said the father.He was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the cranniesof the garret. One would have said that he was a general making thefinal preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point ofbeginning.The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded ina dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in acongealed state:--"What do you mean to do, my dear?""Get into bed," replied the man.His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threwherself heavily on one of the pallets.In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner."What's that?" cried the father.The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting thecorner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breakingthe window; she went off, near her mother's pallet and wept silently.It was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim:--"Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breakingthat pane for you!""So much the better!" said the man. "I foresaw that.""What? So much the better?" retorted his wife."Peace!" replied the father, "I suppress the liberty of the press."Then tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing, he made a stripof cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's bleeding wrist.That done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise."And the chemise too," said he, "this has a good appearance."An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. Theouter mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheetof wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken panethe snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sunof the preceding day had actually come.The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he hadforgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wetbrands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:--"Now," said he, "we can receive the philanthropist."CHAPTER VIII--THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVELThe big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's."Feel how cold I am," said she."Bah!" replied the father, "I am much colder than that."The mother exclaimed impetuously:--"You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even badthings.""Down with you!" said the man.The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removingthe mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her youngersister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter's head betweenher hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her thewhile:--"My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don't cry,you will anger your father.""No!" exclaimed the father, "quite the contrary! sob! sob! that'sright."Then turning to the elder:--"There now! He is not coming! What if he were not to come! I shall haveextinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken mypane all for nothing.""And wounded the child!" murmured the mother."Do you know," went on the father, "that it's beastly cold in thisdevil's garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! Hemakes us wait! He says to himself: 'Well! they will wait for me!That's what they're there for.' Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy,jubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those richfolks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable,who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood,preachy, preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves aboveus, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us'clothes,' as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! Andbread! That's not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it'smoney! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drinkit up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they,then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never couldhave become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the fourcorners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would allbe smashed, very likely, but at least, no one would have anything,and there would be that much gained! But what is that blockhead ofa benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the animal hasforgotten the address! I'll bet that that old beast--"At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to itand opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and smiles of adoration:--"Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and yourcharming young lady, also."A man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on thethreshold of the attic.Marius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassedthe powers of the human tongue.It was She!Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in thosethree letters of that word: She.It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through theluminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was thatsweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six months;it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished facewhich had created night by its departure. The vision had been eclipsed,now it reappeared.It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic, inall that horror.Marius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations of hisheart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of burstinginto tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought herso long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he hadjust found it again.She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face wasframed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneatha pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could becaught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot.She was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.She had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerablybulky parcel on the table.The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staringwith sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, and thatcharming, happy face.CHAPTER IX--JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPINGThe hovel was so dark, that people coming from without felt on enteringit the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two new-comersadvanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly ableto distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could beclearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of thegarret, who were accustomed to this twilight.M. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said toJondrette the father:--"Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and somewoollen stockings and blankets.""Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us," said Jondrette, bowing to thevery earth.Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the twovisitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added ina low and rapid voice:--"Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way,how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?""Fabantou," replied the girl."The dramatic artist, good!"It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at thevery moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of aperson who is seeking to recall a name:--"I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur--""Fabantou," replied Jondrette quickly."Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember.""Dramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success."Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the"philanthropist." He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the sametime of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility ofthe mendicant on the highway:--"A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiledon me--Alas! Now it is misfortune's turn. You see, my benefactor, nobread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat! Abroken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!""Poor woman!" said M. Leblanc."My child wounded!" added Jondrette.The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen tocontemplating "the young lady," and had ceased to sob."Cry! bawl!" said Jondrette to her in a low voice.At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with thetalent of a juggler.The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called "his Ursule,"approached her hastily."Poor, dear child!" said she."You see, my beautiful young lady," pursued Jondrette "her bleedingwrist! It came through an accident while working at a machine to earnsix sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm.""Really?" said the old gentleman, in alarm.The little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violentlythan ever."Alas! yes, my benefactor!" replied the father.For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing "the benefactor"in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the otherattentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All atonce, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were questioning thechild with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife,who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in arapid but very low tone:--"Take a look at that man!"Then, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:--"You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife's chemise! Andall torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can't go out for lack of acoat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars,who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in theRue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in theprovinces. I shared her laurels. Celimene would come to my succor, sir!Elmire would bestow alms on Belisaire! But no, nothing! And not a sou inthe house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured,not a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from herage, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to haveassistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary!How am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is thecondition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charmingyoung lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breatheforth virtue and goodness, and who perfume that church where my daughtersees you every day when she says her prayers?--For I have brought up mychildren religiously, sir. I did not want them to take to the theatre.Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not jest, that I don't!I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! Theyhave got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches whobegin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One isMamselle Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! Noneof that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, andthey shall be honest, and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name!Well, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is going to happen to-morrow?To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last day ofgrace allowed me by my landlord; if by this evening I have not paid myrent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my childwith her wound,--we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown intothe street, on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow.There, sir. I owe for four quarters--a whole year! that is to say, sixtyfrancs."Jondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs,and he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed sinceMarius had paid for two.M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table.Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:--"The scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs?That won't pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That's what comes ofincurring expenses!"In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coatwhich he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of thechair."Monsieur Fabantou," he said, "these five francs are all that I haveabout me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return thisevening,--it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?"Jondrette's face lighted up with a strange expression. He repliedvivaciously:--"Yes, respected sir. At eight o'clock, I must be at my landlord's.""I will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs.""My benefactor!" exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, in alow tone: "Take a good look at him, wife!"M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and hadturned towards the door."Farewell until this evening, my friends!" said he."Six o'clock?" said Jondrette."Six o'clock precisely."At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of theelder Jondrette girl."You are forgetting your coat, sir," said she.Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by aformidable shrug of the shoulders.M. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:--"I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it.""O my protector!" said Jondrette, "my august benefactor, I melt intotears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage.""If you come out," answered M. Leblanc, "put on this coat. It really isvery cold."Jondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the browngreat-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the twostrangers.CHAPTER X--TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOURMarius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in reality, hadseen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his hearthad, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment ofher very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, hehad lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions andprecipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not thatgirl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. Thestar Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been anymore dazzled.While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding theclothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and thelittle injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he soughtto catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form,her walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fanciedthat he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was notabsolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his lifeto hear it, in order that he might bear away in his soul a little ofthat music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamationsand trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrathto Marius' ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believethat it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst ofthose vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that hebeheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, tocling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where shelived, not to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculouslyre-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat.As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point ofopening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor waslong, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had,no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in thecorridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius,in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means toescape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was heto do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriagemight drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk andquitted his room.There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There wasno one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached theboulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue duPetit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle ofthe boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descendingthe Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and therewas no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; andbesides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individualrunning at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father wouldrecognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck,Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There was butone thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. Thatwas sure, efficacious, and free from danger.Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:--"By the hour?"Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destituteof buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbinghis forefinger gently with his thumb."What is it?" said Marius."Pay in advance," said the coachman.Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him."How much?" he demanded."Forty sous.""I will pay on my return."The driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whipup his horse.Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For thelack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness,his love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflectedbitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the fivefrancs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable girl.If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would havebeen born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, hewould have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowedstate; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to thatbeautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes andhad broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel indespair.He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return inthe evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter moreskilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in hiscontemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on theother side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue Dela Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the "philanthropist's"great-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquietingaspect who have been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of the barriers;people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who present theair of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, whichsuggests the supposition that they work by night.These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in thesnow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policemanwould surely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain fromsaying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrettewas talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, aliasBigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a verydangerous nocturnal roamer. This man's name the reader has learned inthe preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille,figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal.He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the stateof tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head ofa school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, atnightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he wasdiscussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, inthat prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served theunprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843,passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carvedby his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts atflight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had notas yet made a serious beginning.CHAPTER XI--OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESSMarius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the momentwhen he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elderJondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight ofthis girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it wastoo late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacrewas far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As forquestioning her about the residence of the persons who had just beenthere, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since theletter signed Fabantou had been addressed "to the benevolent gentlemanof the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas."Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the doorhalf open."What is it?" he asked, "who is there?"It was the Jondrette girl."Is it you?" resumed Marius almost harshly, "still you! What do you wantwith me?"She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer hadthe air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She didnot enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Mariuscould see her through the half-open door."Come now, will you answer?" cried Marius. "What do you want with me?"She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flickervaguely, and said:--"Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?""With me!" said Marius."Yes, you.""There is nothing the matter with me.""Yes, there is!""No.""I tell you there is!""Let me alone!"Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it."Stop," said she, "you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, youwere kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat,now tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not wantyou to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service?Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me,but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since Ihelp my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses,to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one,I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter withyou, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough ifsome one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understandmatters, and everything comes right. Make use of me."An idea flashed across Marius' mind. What branch does one disdain whenone feels that one is falling?He drew near to the Jondrette girl."Listen--" he said to her.She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes."Oh yes, do call me thou! I like that better.""Well," he resumed, "thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and hisdaughter!""Yes.""Dost thou know their address?""No.""Find it for me."The Jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy."Is that what you want?" she demanded."Yes.""Do you know them?""No.""That is to say," she resumed quickly, "you do not know her, but youwish to know her."This them which had turned into her had something indescribablysignificant and bitter about it."Well, can you do it?" said Marius."You shall have the beautiful lady's address."There was still a shade in the words "the beautiful lady" which troubledMarius. He resumed:--"Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Theiraddress, indeed!"She gazed fixedly at him."What will you give me?""Anything you like.""Anything I like?""Yes.""You shall have the address."She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to thedoor, which closed behind her.Marius found himself alone.He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed,absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey tovertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance ofthe angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, agleam of hope floating in an immense despair,--this was what filled hisbrain confusedly.All at once he was violently aroused from his revery.He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, whichwere fraught with a strange interest for him:--"I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him."Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? Thefather of "his Ursule"? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius aboutto obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the informationwithout which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at lastwho it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her fatherwas? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of beingdispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his postnear the little peep-hole in the partition wall.Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette's hovel.CHAPTER XII--THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC'S FIVE-FRANC PIECENothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wifeand daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings andjackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessnessof out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near thefireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand. Hiswife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicativeof astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with longstrides. His eyes were extraordinary.The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presenceof her husband, turned to say:--"What, really? You are sure?""Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognizehim. I knew him at once! What! Didn't it force itself on you?""No.""But I told you: 'Pay attention!' Why, it is his figure, it is his face,only older,--there are people who do not grow old, I don't know how theymanage it,--it is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed,that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I've got you, that I have!"He paused, and said to his daughters:--"Get out of here, you!--It's queer that it didn't strike you!"They arose to obey.The mother stammered:--"With her injured hand.""The air will do it good," said Jondrette. "Be off."It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers toreply. The two girls departed.At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the fatherdetained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:--"You will be here at five o'clock precisely. Both of you. I shall needyou."Marius redoubled his attention.On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the roomagain, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then hespent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemisewhich he wore into his trousers.All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms andexclaimed:--"And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady--""Well, what?" retorted his wife, "the young lady?"Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they werespeaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in hisears.But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then hestraightened himself up and concluded aloud:--"It is she!""That one?" said his wife."That very one," said the husband.No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words.Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrousintonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, whichher husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge,somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible."It is not possible!" she cried. "When I think that my daughters aregoing barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satinpelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundredfrancs' worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No,you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, andthis one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can'tbe she!""I tell you that it is she. You will see."At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red,blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression.At that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than herhusband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress."What!" she resumed, "that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed atmy daughters with an air of pity,--she is that beggar brat! Oh! I shouldlike to kick her stomach in for her!"She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, herhair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fistsclenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. Theman paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female.After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the femaleJondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had donea moment before:--"And shall I tell you another thing?""What is it?" she asked.He answered in a low, curt voice:--"My fortune is made."The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: "Is the person whois addressing me on the point of going mad?"He went on:--"Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner ofthe parish ofdie-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I havehad enough of misery! my share and other people's share! I am not jokingany longer, I don't find it comic any more, I've had enough of puns,good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full,I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I wantto have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit ofa millionnaire!"He took a turn round the hovel, and added:--"Like other people.""What do you mean by that?" asked the woman.He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice likea medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:--"What do I mean by that? Listen!""Hush!" muttered the woman, "not so loud! These are matters which mustnot be overheard.""Bah! Who's here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago.Besides, he doesn't listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw himgo out."Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice,although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. Onefavorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of thisconversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicleson the boulevard.This is what Marius heard:--"Listen carefully. The Croesus is caught, or as good as caught! That'sall settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. Hewill come here this evening at six o'clock. To bring sixty francs, therascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs,my landlord, my fourth of February? I don't even owe for one quarter!Isn't he a fool! So he will come at six o'clock! That's the hour whenour neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes inthe city. There's not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes homeuntil eleven o'clock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall helpus. He will give in.""And what if he does not give in?" demanded his wife.Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:--"We'll fix him."And he burst out laughing.This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was coldand sweet, and provoked a shudder.Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an oldcap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve."Now," said he, "I'm going out. I have some more people that I must see.Good ones. You'll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall beaway as short a time as possible, it's a fine stroke of business, do youlook after the house."And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stoodfor a moment in thought, then exclaimed:--"Do you know, it's mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn't recognizeme! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come backagain. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard thatsaved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!"And again he broke into a laugh.He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking thegray of the sky."What beastly weather!" said he.Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:--"This rind is too large for me. Never mind," he added, "he did adevilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If ithadn't been for that, I couldn't have gone out, and everything wouldhave gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!"And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, whenthe door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made itsappearance once more in the opening."I came near forgetting," said he. "You are to have a brazier ofcharcoal ready."And he flung into his wife's apron the five-franc piece which the"philanthropist" had left with him."A brazier of charcoal?" asked his wife."Yes.""How many bushels?""Two good ones.""That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something fordinner.""The devil, no.""Why?""Don't go and spend the hundred-sou piece.""Why?""Because I shall have to buy something, too.""What?""Something.""How much shall you need?""Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?""Rue Mouffetard.""Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.""But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?""Fifty sous--three francs.""There won't be much left for dinner.""Eating is not the point to-day. There's something better to be done.""That's enough, my jewel."At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and thistime, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, anddescend the staircase rapidly.At that moment, one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard.CHAPTER XIII--SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORAREPATER NOSTERMarius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic bynature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed inhim sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty forirritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he hadthe kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pityupon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipersthat his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters thathe had beneath his eyes."These wretches must be stamped upon," said he.Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had beenelucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense,if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of theLuxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrettewas acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had beenuttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was thefact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terribletrap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, herfather certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of theJondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an oldsheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heapof iron.He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not tomake the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, andin the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienceda sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps torender a service to the one whom he loved.But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did notknow their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Shouldhe wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock, at themoment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and hismen would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were strongerthan he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, andthe man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock hadjust struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hoursbefore him.There was but one thing to be done.He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck,took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he hadbeen treading on moss with bare feet.Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wallwhich a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts ona waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupiedcondition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once heheard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street wasdeserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet hedistinctly heard voices.It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs againstthe wall, talking together in subdued tones.These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in ablouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded manhad on a fez, the other's head was bare, and the snow had lodged in hishair.By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.The hairy one jogged the other man's elbow and said:--"--With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can't fail.""Do you think so?" said the bearded man.And the long-haired one began again:--"It's as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and theworst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!"The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:--"That's a real thing. You can't go against such things.""I tell you that the affair can't go wrong," resumed the long-hairedman. "Father What's-his-name's team will be already harnessed."Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on thepreceding evening at the Gaite Theatre.Marius went his way.It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangelyhidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bearsome relation to Jondrette's abominable projects. That must be theaffair.He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked atthe first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.Thither Marius betook himself.As he passed a baker's shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it,foreseeing that he should not dine.On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had henot given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, hewould have followed M. Leblanc's fiacre, and consequently have remainedignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle tothe trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, andhis daughter with him, no doubt.CHAPTER XIV--IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYEROn arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floorand inquired for the commissary of police."The commissary of police is not here," said a clerk; "but there is aninspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are youin haste?""Yes," said Marius.The clerk introduced him into the commissary's office. There stood atall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up withboth hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His facewas square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferociouswhiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out.Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, butthat it searched.This man's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible thanJondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than thewolf."What do you want?" he said to Marius, without adding "monsieur.""Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?""He is absent. I am here in his stead.""The matter is very private.""Then speak.""And great haste is required.""Then speak quick."This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and thesame time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventureto him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than bysight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as heoccupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer,had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch whohad planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would beaccomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others acertain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette'sdaughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning thethreatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally,all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at the mostdeserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52.At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and saidcoldly:--"So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?""Precisely," answered Marius, and he added: "Are you acquainted withthat house?"The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmedthe heel of his boot at the door of the stove:--"Apparently."He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius somuch as his cravat:--"Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this."This word struck Marius."Patron-Minette," said he, "I did hear that word pronounced, in fact."And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-hairedman and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue duPetit-Banquier.The inspector muttered:--"The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard,alias Deux-Milliards."He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought."As for Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I'veburned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves.Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau."Then he glanced at Marius."You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?""And Panchaud.""You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?""No.""Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin desPlantes?""No.""Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?""No.""As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, andemployees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.""No. Who are all those persons?" asked Marius.The inspector answered:--"Besides, this is not the time for them."He relapsed into silence, then resumed:--"50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves insideit without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simplyby countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audienceembarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them singand make them dance."This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing athim intently the while:--"Are you afraid?""Of what?" said Marius."Of these men?""No more than yourself!" retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to noticethat this police agent had not yet said "monsieur" to him.The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued withsententious solemnity:--"There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage doesnot fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority."Marius interrupted him:--"That is well, but what do you intend to do?"The inspector contented himself with the remark:--"The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must haveone.""Yes," said Marius."Have you it about you?""Yes.""Give it to me," said the inspector.Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to theinspector and added:--"If you will take my advice, you will come in force."The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might havebestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him;with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into thetwo immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steelpistols, of the sort called "knock-me-downs." Then he presented them toMarius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:--"Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposedto have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You willkeep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. Thesemen will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When youthink matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stopto them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot intothe ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon.Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are alawyer; you know the proper point." Marius took the pistols and put themin the side pocket of his coat."That makes a lump that can be seen," said the inspector. "Put them inyour trousers pocket."Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets."Now," pursued the inspector, "there is not a minute more to be lost byany one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o'clock is the hour?""Six o'clock," answered Marius."I have plenty of time," said the inspector, "but no more than enough.Don't forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot.""Rest easy," said Marius.And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out,the inspector called to him:--"By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then,come or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert."CHAPTER XV--JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASESA few moments later, about three o'clock, Courfeyrac chanced to bepassing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow hadredoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying toCourfeyrac:--"One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was aplague of white butterflies in heaven." All at once, Bossuet caughtsight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiarair."Hold!" said Bossuet. "There's Marius.""I saw him," said Courfeyrac. "Don't let's speak to him.""Why?""He is busy.""With what?""Don't you see his air?""What air?""He has the air of a man who is following some one.""That's true," said Bossuet."Just see the eyes he is making!" said Courfeyrac."But who the deuce is he following?""Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He's in love.""But," observed Bossuet, "I don't see any wench nor any flowery bonnetin the street. There's not a woman round."Courfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:--"He's following a man!"A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could bedistinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along abouttwenty paces in advance of Marius.This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and toolarge for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in ragsand black with mud.Bossuet burst out laughing."Who is that man?""He?" retorted Courfeyrac, "he's a poet. Poets are very fond of wearingthe trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers ofFrance.""Let's see where Marius will go," said Bossuet; "let's see where the manis going, let's follow them, hey?""Bossuet!" exclaimed Courfeyrac, "eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigiousbrute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!"They retraced their steps.Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard,and was spying on his proceedings.Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was alreadyheld by a glance.He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the mostterrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarterof an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted atan ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner of the RuePierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from theshop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle,which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the RuePetit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue duPetit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for amoment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at thevery corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual,and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so,for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard thelong-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round,made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then sprangacross the wall and disappeared.The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard ofan ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who stillkept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds.Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette's absence toreturn home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma'am Bougonwhen she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of lockingthe door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key tothe inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he shouldmake haste.Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and inthe immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by thesun, and that was the moon.It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere.Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still openwhen he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along thewall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader willremember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, forthe moment, empty and to let. Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leavingall the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thoughthe perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men,vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormerwindow.Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. Hesucceeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without makingany noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma'am Bougon takeher departure, locking the door of the house behind her.CHAPTER XVI--IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICHWAS IN FASHION IN 1832Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past fiveo'clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen.He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watchin the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at thatmoment in the dark,--crime advancing on one side, justice coming up onthe other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudderof what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who aresuddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day producedupon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that hewas not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of thesteel pistols in his trousers pockets.It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and moreclearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflectionof the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort oftwilight aspect.There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wallshining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was movingthere, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial andprofound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thoughthimself next door to a sepulchre.Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges;a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; thelatch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret.Only, it had been silent in the master's absence, like wolf whelps inthe absence of the wolf."It's I," said he."Good evening, daddy," yelped the girls."Well?" said the mother."All's going first-rate," responded Jondrette, "but my feet are beastlycold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspireconfidence.""All ready to go out.""Don't forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?""Rest easy.""Because--" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chiselwhich he had purchased."By the way," said Jondrette, "have you been eating here?""Yes," said the mother. "I got three large potatoes and some salt. Itook advantage of the fire to cook them.""Good," returned Jondrette. "To-morrow I will take you out to dine withme. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles theTenth; all is going well!"Then he added:--"The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there."He lowered his voice still further, and said:--"Put this in the fire."Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or someiron utensil, and Jondrette continued:--"Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?""Yes," replied the mother."What time is it?""Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago.""The devil!" ejaculated Jondrette; "the children must go and watch. Comeyou, do you listen here."A whispering ensued.Jondrette's voice became audible again:--"Has old Bougon left?""Yes," said the mother."Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room?""He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is hisdinner hour.""You are sure?""Sure.""All the same," said Jondrette, "there's no harm in going to see whetherhe is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there."Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through thecrack of his door."P'pa," cried a voice, "he is not in here."He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter."Did you go in?" demanded her father."No," replied the girl, "but as his key is in the door, he must be out."The father exclaimed:--"Go in, nevertheless."The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candlein her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still morerepulsive in this light.She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribablemoment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to thewall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raisedherself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room,the sound of iron articles being moved was audible.She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into themirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:--          Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine,[28]          Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!          S'adorer huit jours, c' etait bien la peine!          Le temps des amours devait durer toujours!          Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that sheshould not hear his breathing.She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way shehad."How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!" said she.She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn."Well!" cried her father, "what are you about there?""I am looking under the bed and the furniture," she replied, continuingto arrange her hair; "there's no one here.""Booby!" yelled her father. "Come here this minute! And don't waste anytime about it!""Coming! Coming!" said she. "One has no time for anything in thishovel!"She hummed:--          Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire;[29]          Mon triste coeur suivra partout.She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the doorbehind her.A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls' barefeet in the corridor, and Jondrette's voice shouting to them:--"Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at thecorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don't lose sight for a moment ofthe door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here onthe instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in."The eldest girl grumbled:--"The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!""To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!" said thefather.They ran down stairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outerdoor as it banged to announced that they were outside.There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes andprobably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught aglimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.CHAPTER XVII--THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE-FRANC PIECEMarius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume hispost at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of hisage, he had reached the hole in the partition.He looked.The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, andMarius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed.A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, butthat was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completelyilluminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather largesheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burningcharcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. Thecharcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickeredover it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased byJondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into thebrazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though preparedfor some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, theone a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would havecaused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation,to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea. The lair thuslighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette,in this light, had rather the air of a demon than of a smith.The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table wasmelting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An olddark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood onthe chimney-piece.The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinctbrands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast itswhiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spiritof Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like athought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped todissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of thebrazier.The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of theGorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violentand sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the mostretired chamber in the most isolated house on the most desertedboulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not alreadyexisted, they would have been invented there.The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited roomsseparated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existedopened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair,and was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men wholaugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter whenhis gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet withplumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation ofCharles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and theman's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was thistoilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: "Good! Youhave dressed up. You have done well. You must inspire confidence!"As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was toolarge for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costumecontinued to present that contrast of coat and trousers whichconstituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes.All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:--"By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in acarriage. Light the lantern, take it and go down stairs. You will standbehind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop,you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light thestaircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go downstairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman, anddismiss the fiacre.""And the money?" inquired the woman.Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs."What's this?" she exclaimed.Jondrette replied with dignity:--"That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning."And he added:--"Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.""What for?""To sit on."Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mildanswer from Jondrette."Pardieu! I'll go and get one of our neighbor's."And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went outinto the corridor.Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reachhis bed, and conceal himself beneath it."Take the candle," cried Jondrette."No," said she, "it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry.There is moonlight."Marius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in thedark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock andwith horror.The Jondrette entered.The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight betweentwo blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered thewall against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the twochairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting thedoor fall heavily to behind her.She re-entered the lair."Here are the two chairs.""And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can."She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned thechisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen whichmasked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pileof rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius thenrecognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was avery well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with whichto attach it.This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which weremingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in theJondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thitherin the afternoon, during Marius' absence."Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker," thought Marius.Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would haverecognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker,certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and otherswhich will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars callcadets and fauchants.The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. Thebrazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnishedby the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on thechimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribablycalm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that thereexisted in it the anticipation of something terrible.Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign ofpreoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out thefierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls andin abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding tothe last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one ofthese dark replies which he was making to himself, he pulled the tabledrawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen knife which wasconcealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done,he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it outand cocked it.The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh andsaid:--"What a fool I am! It's the partition cracking!"Marius kept the pistol in his hand.CHAPTER XVIII--MARIUS' TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VISSuddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook thepanes. Six o'clock was striking from Saint-Medard.Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixthhad struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor,walked on again, then listened once more."Provided only that he comes!" he muttered, then he returned to hischair.He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor makinga horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lanternilluminated from below."Enter, sir," she said."Enter, my benefactor," repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.M. Leblanc made his appearance.He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.He laid four louis on the table."Monsieur Fabantou," said he, "this is for your rent and your mostpressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.""May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!" said Jondrette.And rapidly approaching his wife:--"Dismiss the carriage!"She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offeringM. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in hisear:--"'Tis done."The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deepthat the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did notnow hear its departure.Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let thereader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudesof the Salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding-sheets inthe moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shoneredly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rowsof black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around,the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and ofdarkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in themidst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a singlecandle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil,Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf,in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, notlosing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, andpistol in hand.However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. Heclasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. "I shall beable to stop that wretch whenever I please," he thought.He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting forthe signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.Moreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondretteand M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he wasinterested in learning.CHAPTER XIX--OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHSHardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards thepallets, which were empty."How is the poor little wounded girl?" he inquired."Bad," replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, "verybad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe tohave her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be backimmediately.""Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better," went on M. Leblanc, castinghis eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stoodbetween him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazedat him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat."She is dying," said Jondrette. "But what do you expect, sir! She has somuch courage, that woman has! She's not a woman, she's an ox."The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with theaffected airs of a flattered monster."You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!""Jondrette!" said M. Leblanc, "I thought your name was Fabantou?""Fabantou, alias Jondrette!" replied the husband hurriedly. "An artisticsobriquet!"And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc didnot catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection ofvoice:--"Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! Whatwould there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, myrespectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will,no work! I don't know how the government arranges that, but, on my wordof honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.[30] I don'twish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word,things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have mygirls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: 'What!a trade?' Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall,my benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been!Alas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thingonly, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willingto part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!"While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence whichdetracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of hisphysiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end ofthe room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered,so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. Thisman wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut andgaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes onhis feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and hisface smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearestbed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctlyseen.That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could notrefrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette."Ah! I see!" exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air ofcomplaisance, "you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith,but it fits me!""Who is that man?" said M. Leblanc."Him?" ejaculated Jondrette, "he's a neighbor of mine. Don't pay anyattention to him."The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactoriesof chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of theworkmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc's whole personwas expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.He went on:--"Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?""I was telling you, sir, and dear protector," replied Jondrette placinghis elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady andtender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, "I was tellingyou, that I have a picture to sell."A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered andseated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink orlampblack.Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not beenable to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him."Don't mind them," said Jondrette, "they are people who belong in thehouse. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuablepicture. But stop, sir, take a look at it."He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which wehave already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supportedagainst the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, andwhich the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out ofit, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarsedaub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudityof foreign canvasses and screen paintings."What is that?" asked M. Leblanc.Jondrette exclaimed:--"A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I amas much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirsto me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am sowretched that I will part with it."Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness,M. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examinedthe picture.There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near thedoor-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smearedwith black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, withclosed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. Hewas old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced ahorrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, theother wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did notwear socks were barefooted.Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these men."They are friends. They are neighbors," said he. "Their faces are blackbecause they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don't troubleyourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity onmy misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it isworth?""Well," said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with themanner of a man who is on his guard, "it is some signboard for a tavern,and is worth about three francs."Jondrette replied sweetly:--"Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with athousand crowns."M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapidglance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side nextthe window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, onthe side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seemto be looking on.Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vaguean eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might havesupposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone madwith misery."If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor," said Jondrette, "Ishall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me butto throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have mytwo girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxesfor New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep theglasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, apot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength ofthe paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, aparing-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer tonail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all thatin order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours aday! And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times!And you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you mustkeep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do yousuppose a man is to live?"As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observinghim. M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette's eye wasfixed on the door. Marius' eager attention was transferred from oneto the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: "Is this man anidiot?" Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all mannerof varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: "Thereis nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went downthree steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day forthat purpose."All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the littleman drew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblancand cried in a voice of thunder: "That has nothing to do with thequestion! Do you know me?"CHAPTER XX--THE TRAPThe door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view ofthree men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of blackpaper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; thesecond, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of thehandle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe for slaughteringcattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender asthe first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of someprison.It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had beenwaiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with thecudgel, the thin one."Is everything ready?" said Jondrette."Yes," replied the thin man."Where is Montparnasse?""The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.""Which?""The eldest.""Is there a carriage at the door?""Yes.""Is the team harnessed?""Yes.""With two good horses?""Excellent.""Is it waiting where I ordered?""Yes.""Good," said Jondrette.M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him inthe den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and hishead, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, movedon his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but therewas nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvisedan intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instantpreviously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, hadsuddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on theback of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such adanger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageousas they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom welove is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: "They arechimney-builders," had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, onewith a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the thirdwith a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance withoututtering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merelyopened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him.Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for interventionwould arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in thedirection of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanyingit with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar tohim:--"So you do not recognize me?"M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:--"No."Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M.Leblanc's calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M.Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about tobite, he exclaimed:--"My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name isThenardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?Thenardier! Now do you know me?"An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc's brow, and he repliedwith a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,with his accustomed placidity:--"No more than before."Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that momentthrough the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard,stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: "My name isThenardier," Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned againstthe wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart.Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, droppedslowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, "Thenardier, do youunderstand?" Marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistolfall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc,but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thenardier, with which M.Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the readerrecall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart,inscribed in his father's testament! He bore it at the bottom of hismind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: "A certainThenardier saved my life. If my son encounters him, he will do him allthe good that lies in his power." That name, it will be remembered,was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name ofhis father in his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, thatinn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! Hehad found him at last, and how? His father's saviour was a ruffian!That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, wasa monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the pointof committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearlycomprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom,great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His fatherhad commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good inhis power to this Thenardier, and for four years Marius had cherishedno other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's, and at themoment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the veryact of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: "This is Thenardier!"He could at last repay this man for his father's life, saved amid ahail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay itwith the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found thatThenardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet;and now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him overto the executioner! His father said to him: "Succor Thenardier!" And hereplied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing Thenardier! He wasabout to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man whohad torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on thePlace Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whomhe had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have solong worn on his breast his father's last commands, written in his ownhand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the otherhand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim andto spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards somiserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for thelast four years were pierced through and through, as it were, by thisunforeseen blow.He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, heheld in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before hiseyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thenardier lost;if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows?Thenardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the otherto fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperioussouvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty,to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father's testament,or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to himthat he heard "his Ursule" supplicating for her father and on the other,the colonel commending Thenardier to his care. He felt that he was goingmad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time fordeliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyeswas hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which hehad thought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. Hewas on the verge of swooning.In the meantime, Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no othername, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzyand wild triumph.He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece withso violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and thetallow bespattered the wall.Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out thesewords:--"Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!"And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption."Ah!" he cried, "so I've found you again at last, Mister philanthropist!Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you oldninny! Ah! so you don't recognize me! No, it wasn't you who came toMontfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! Itwasn't you who carried off that Fantine's child from me! The Lark! Itwasn't you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds inyour hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be hismania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charitymonger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? Yougive away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merryAndrew! Ah! and you don't recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that Ido! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. Ah!you'll find out presently, that it isn't all roses to thrust yourselfin that fashion into people's houses, under the pretext that they aretaverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poor man, to whom onewould give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take awaytheir means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and youcan't call things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, youbring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospital blankets, youold blackguard, you child-stealer!"He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One wouldhave said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone;then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had beensaying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, andshouted:--"And with his goody-goody air!"And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:--"Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all mymisfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, andwho certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in agreat deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to liveon all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything thatI lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continualrow, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish allthe wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it!Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous when youwent off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were thestronger. Revenge. I'm the one to hold the trumps to-day! You're in asorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn'the fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name wasFabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with MamselleMuche, that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th ofFebruary, and he didn't even notice that the 8th of January, and not the4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot!And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel!He hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And howhe swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said to myself:'Blockhead! Come, I've got you! I lick your paws this morning, but I'llgnaw your heart this evening!'"Thenardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest pantedlike a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of afeeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last,harass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy ofa dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, thejoy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly deadthat he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently alive to sufferstill.M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:--"I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a verypoor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You aremistaking me for some other person.""Ah!" roared Thenardier hoarsely, "a pretty lie! You stick to thatpleasantry, do you! You're floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don'tremember! You don't see who I am?""Excuse me, sir," said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which atthat moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, "I see that you area villain!"Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess asusceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word"villain," the female Thenardier sprang from the bed, Thenardier graspedhis chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. "Don't youstir!" he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:--"Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop!it's true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have nobread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It's threedays since I have had anything to eat, so I'm a villain! Ah! you folkswarm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats,like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that haveporters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunchin the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and whenyou want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see whatthe engineer Chevalier's thermometer says about it. We, it is we who arethermometers. We don't need to go out and look on the quay at the cornerof the Tour de l'Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold;we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round ourhearts, and we say: 'There is no God!' And you come to our caverns, yesour caverns, for the purpose of calling us villains! But we'll devouryou! But we'll devour you, poor little things! Just see here, Mistermillionnaire: I have been a solid man, I have held a license, I havebeen an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And it's quite possiblethat you are not!"Here Thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, andadded with a shudder:--"When I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like acobbler!"Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:--"And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I'm not a suspiciouscharacter, not a bit of it! I'm not a man whose name nobody knows, andwho comes and abducts children from houses! I'm an old French soldier,I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in thebattle I saved a general called the Comte of I don't know what. He toldme his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn't hear. All Icaught was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name than his thanks.That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you seehere, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,--do you know whatit represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize thatfeat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying himthrough the grape-shot. There's the history of it! That general neverdid a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But none theless, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificateof the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies!And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, let's have anend of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormouslot of money, or I'll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!"Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and waslistening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainlywas the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach ofingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the pointof so fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.Moreover, there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his accent, inhis gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, therewas, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in thatmixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rageand folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, inthat immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delightsof violence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in thatconflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, somethingwhich was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposedthat M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader hasdivined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered,by himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck atMontfermeil.As he had ceased to intercept Marius' visual ray, Marius could examinethis thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, abackground of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the groupcomposed of Pontmercy and Thenardier; the sergeant the rescuer, thecolonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restoredhis father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of thewine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, aphantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples,he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguelydepicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him thatthe misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.When Thenardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyeson M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:--"What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?"M. Leblanc held his peace.In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrioussarcasm from the corridor:--"If there's any wood to be split, I'm there!"It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made itsappearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,but fangs.It was the face of the man with the butcher's axe."Why have you taken off your mask?" cried Thenardier in a rage."For fun," retorted the man.For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching andfollowing all the movements of Thenardier, who, blinded and dazzled byhis own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidencethat the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he beingarmed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the femaleThenardier counted for but one man.During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his backto M. Leblanc.M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot andthe table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility,before Thenardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. Toopen it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a secondonly. He was half out when six robust fists seized him and draggedhim back energetically into the hovel. These were the three"chimney-builders," who had flung themselves upon him. At the same timethe Thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from thecorridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influenceof wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with astone-breaker's hammer in his hand.One of the "chimney-builders," whose smirched face was lighted up bythe candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing,Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc'shead a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of abar of iron.Marius could not resist this sight. "My father," he thought, "forgiveme!"And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardier's voiceshouted:--"Don't harm him!"This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thenardier,had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man andthe adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in thepresence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did notstir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled andtried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand."Don't hurt him!" he repeated, and without suspecting it, his firstsuccess was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and toparalyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared,and who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waitinga while longer.Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver himfrom the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule's father to perish, orof destroying the colonel's saviour?A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of theroom, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown twomore assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretcheswere rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granitemillstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by botharms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over thetwo "chimney-builders" on the floor.Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing thosebeneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vainto shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblancdisappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boarbeneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, andthere they held him in awe. The Thenardier woman had not released herclutch on his hair."Don't you mix yourself up in this affair," said Thenardier. "You'lltear your shawl."The Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with agrowl."Now," said Thenardier, "search him, you other fellows!"M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.They searched him.He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing sixfrancs, and his handkerchief.Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket."What! No pocket-book?" he demanded."No, nor watch," replied one of the "chimney-builders.""Never mind," murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in thevoice of a ventriloquist, "he's a tough old fellow."Thenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropesand threw them at the men."Tie him to the leg of the bed," said he.And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across theroom by the blow from M. Leblanc's fist, and who made no movement, headded:--"Is Boulatruelle dead?""No," replied Bigrenaille, "he's drunk.""Sweep him into a corner," said Thenardier.Two of the "chimney-builders" pushed the drunken man into the cornernear the heap of old iron with their feet."Babet," said Thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, "whydid you bring so many; they were not needed.""What can you do?" replied the man with the cudgel, "they all wanted tobe in it. This is a bad season. There's no business going on."The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospitalbed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.M. Leblanc let them take their own course.The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feeton the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote fromthe window, and nearest to the fireplace.When the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair and seatedhimself almost facing M. Leblanc.Thenardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few momentshis face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunningsweetness.Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a manin official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but amoment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarmingmetamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tigerconverted into a lawyer."Monsieur--" said Thenardier.And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands onM. Leblanc:--"Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman."All retired towards the door.He went on:--"Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You mighthave broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will conversequietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observationwhich I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry."Thenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escapedMarius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the sixruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singularsilence.Thenardier continued:--"Mon Dieu! You might have shouted 'stop thief' a bit, and I should nothave thought it improper. 'Murder!' That, too, is said occasionally,and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part.It is very natural that you should make a little row when you findyourself with persons who don't inspire you with sufficient confidence.You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on thataccount. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why.This room is very private. That's its only recommendation, but it hasthat in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produceabout as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of adrunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would makea pouf. It's a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, andit is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you theconclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts,who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You have notmade an outcry; that is because you don't care to have the police andthe courts come in any more than we do. It is because,--I have longsuspected it,--you have some interest in hiding something. On our sidewe have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding."As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, who kept his eyesfixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which dartedfrom the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, hislanguage, which was stamped with a sort of moderated, subdued insolenceand crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice, and in thatrascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously, onenow felt "the man who had studied for the priesthood."The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had beencarried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, thatresistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to uttera cry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention hadbeen called to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painfulastonishment.Thenardier's well-grounded observation still further obscured for Mariusthe dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whomCourfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, halfplunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to theextent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presenceof Thenardier's wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this manremained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such amoment the superbly melancholy visage.Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and whichdid not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men whocommand amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis,inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agonyof the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.Thenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shovedaside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, andthus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisonercould plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there withtiny scarlet stars.Then Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc."I continue," said he. "We can come to an understanding. Let us arrangethis matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now,I don't know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I saidextravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I toldyou that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That wouldnot be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expensesof your own--who has not? I don't want to ruin you, I am not a greedyfellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because they havethe advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselvesridiculous. Why, I'm taking things into consideration and making asacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs."M. Leblanc uttered not a word.Thenardier went on:--"You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I'm very moderate. Idon't know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don't stickat money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give twohundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck.Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven't imagined that I shouldtake all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair thisevening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of thesegentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drinkred wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer's. Two hundredthousand francs--it's surely worth all that. This trifle once out ofyour pocket, I guarantee you that that's the end of the matter, and thatyou have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: 'But I haven'ttwo hundred thousand francs about me.' Oh! I'm not extortionate. I don'tdemand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to writewhat I am about to dictate to you."Here Thenardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, andcasting a smile in the direction of the brazier:--"I warn you that I shall not admit that you don't know how to write."A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.Thenardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, andin which gleamed the long blade of the knife.He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc."Write," said he.The prisoner spoke at last."How do you expect me to write? I am bound.""That's true, excuse me!" ejaculated Thenardier, "you are quite right."And turning to Bigrenaille:--"Untie the gentleman's right arm."Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thenardier'sorder.When the prisoner's right arm was free, Thenardier dipped the pen in theink and presented it to him."Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at ourdiscretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that weshall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeableextremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you,that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying theletter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so goodas to write.""What?" demanded the prisoner."I will dictate."M. Leblanc took the pen.Thenardier began to dictate:--"My daughter--"The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thenardier."Put down 'My dear daughter'--" said Thenardier.M. Leblanc obeyed.Thenardier continued:--"Come instantly--"He paused:--"You address her as thou, do you not?""Who?" asked M. Leblanc."Parbleu!" cried Thenardier, "the little one, the Lark."M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:--"I do not know what you mean.""Go on, nevertheless," ejaculated Thenardier, and he continued todictate:--"Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who willdeliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I amwaiting for thee. Come with confidence."M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.Thenardier resumed:--"Ah! erase 'come with confidence'; that might lead her to suppose thateverything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible."M. Leblanc erased the three words."Now," pursued Thenardier, "sign it. What's your name?"The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:--"For whom is this letter?""You know well," retorted Thenardier, "for the little one I just toldyou so."It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl inquestion. He said "the Lark," he said "the little one," but he did notpronounce her name--the precaution of a clever man guarding his secretfrom his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole"affair" into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there wasany need of their knowing.He went on:--"Sign. What is your name?""Urbain Fabre," said the prisoner.Thenardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocketand drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. Helooked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle."U. F. That's it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F."The prisoner signed."As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I willfold it."That done, Thenardier resumed:--"Address it, 'Mademoiselle Fabre,' at your house. I know that you livea long distance from here, near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas, because you goto mass there every day, but I don't know in what street. I see thatyou understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name, youwill not lie about your address. Write it yourself."The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen andwrote:--"Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre's, Rue Saint-Dominique-D'Enfer,No. 17."Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion."Wife!" he cried.The Thenardier woman hastened to him."Here's the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage atthe door. Set out at once, and return ditto."And addressing the man with the meat-axe:--"Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. Youwill get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?""Yes," said the man.And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thenardier.As they set off, Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door,and shouted into the corridor:--"Above all things, don't lose the letter! remember that you carry twohundred thousand francs with you!"The Thenardier's hoarse voice replied:--"Be easy. I have it in my bosom."A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip washeard, which rapidly retreated and died away."Good!" growled Thenardier. "They're going at a fine pace. At such agallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour."He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presentinghis muddy boots to the brazier."My feet are cold!" said he.Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and theprisoner.These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces,and made of them, at fear's pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, ordemons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that theyperpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrathor mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one cornerlike brutes, and remained silent.Thenardier warmed his feet.The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm hadsucceeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a fewmoments before.The candle, on which a large "stranger" had formed, cast but a dimlight in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all thosemonstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,who was fast asleep.Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle.The enigma was more impenetrable than ever.Who was this "little one" whom Thenardier had called the Lark? Was shehis "Ursule"? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word,"the Lark," and had replied in the most natural manner in the world:"I do not know what you mean." On the other hand, the two letters U. F.were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer namedUrsule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from whichhe was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood,almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by theabominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hopeof some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not collecthis thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide."In any case," he said, "if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for theThenardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and thenI will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!Nothing shall stop me."Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thenardier seemed to beabsorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Mariusfancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard afaint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.All at once, Thenardier addressed the prisoner:"By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once."These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Mariusstrained his ears."My wife will be back shortly, don't get impatient. I think that theLark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that youshould keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt herup with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did,so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her.They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere,outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses.Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre.My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will comeback here to tell us: 'It's done.' As for the young lady, no harm willbe done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will bequiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little twohundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have mearrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that'sall."The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thenardiercontinued:--"It's very simple, as you see. There'll be no harm done unless you wishthat there should be harm done. I'm telling you how things stand. I warnyou so that you may be prepared."He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thenardierresumed:--"As soon as my wife returns and says to me: 'The Lark is on the way,' wewill release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You seethat our intentions are not evil."Terrible images passed through Marius' mind. What! That young girl whomthey were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsterswas to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels inthe hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, nonethe less, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected onThenardier's words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: "Ifyou have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to theLark."Now, it was not alone by the colonel's testament, it was by his ownlove, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himselfrestrained.This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour,was changing its aspect every moment.Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all themost heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of theden.In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircasewas heard to open and shut again.The prisoner made a movement in his bonds."Here's the bourgeoise," said Thenardier.He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thenardier woman did in factrush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes,and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:--"False address!"The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her andpicked up his axe again.She resumed:--"Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre!They know not what it means!"She paused, choking, then went on:--"Monsieur Thenardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good,you see! If it had been me, I'd have chopped the beast in four quartersto begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I'd have boiled him alive! Hewould have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and wherehe keeps his shiners! That's the way I should have managed matters!People are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupiderthan women! Nobody at No. 17. It's nothing but a big carriage gate! NoMonsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racingand fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and theportress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!"Marius breathed freely once more.She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.While his exasperated wife vociferated, Thenardier had seated himself onthe table.For several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot,which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocioustone:"A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?""To gain time!" cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at thesame instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner wasonly attached to the bed now by one leg.Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward,he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to thebrazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thenardier,the female Thenardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at theextremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost freeand in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hotchisel, which emitted a threatening glow.The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau houseeventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cutand worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when thepolice made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvelsof industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys inthe shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else thaninstruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderfulart are to jewellers' work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry.There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villonsin language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds meanssometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife,to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates withoutaffecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the souin such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwedtogether and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides awatch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sizedchains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possessmerely a sou; not at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou ofthis sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was foundunder the bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steelwhich would fit the sou.It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at themoment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to concealit in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, heunscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him,which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movementswhich Marius had observed.As he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, hehad not cut the bonds of his left leg.The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise."Be easy," said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. "He still holds by one leg,and he can't get away. I'll answer for that. I tied that paw for him."In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:--"You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me writewhat I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do notchoose to say--"He stripped up his left sleeve, and added:--"See here."At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chiselwhich he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiarto chambers of torture filled the hovel.[Illustration: Red Hot Chisel  3b8-20-red-hot-chisel]Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly amuscle of the old man's face contracted, and while the red-hot ironsank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed onThenardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and wheresuffering vanished in serene majesty.With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senseswhen subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, andmake it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery forcethe captain to show himself."Wretches!" said he, "have no more fear of me than I have for you!"And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window,which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared intothe night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.The prisoner resumed:--"Do what you please with me." He was disarmed."Seize him!" said Thenardier.Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the maskedman with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him,ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquyconducted in a low tone:--"There is only one thing left to do.""Cut his throat.""That's it."It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.Thenardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, andtook out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol.Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in hisconscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament, theother crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continueduninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony. Up to thatmoment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some meansof reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the limits ofpossibility had presented itself.However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had beenreached; Thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant fromthe prisoner.Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource ofdespair. All at once a shudder ran through him.At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moonilluminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On thispaper he read the following line written that very morning, in largeletters, by the eldest of the Thenardier girls:--"THE BOBBIES ARE HERE."An idea, a flash, crossed Marius' mind; this was the expedient of whichhe was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which wastorturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet ofpaper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paperround it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle ofthe den.It was high time. Thenardier had conquered his last fears or his lastscruples, and was advancing on the prisoner."Something is falling!" cried the Thenardier woman."What is it?" asked her husband.The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed itto her husband."Where did this come from?" demanded Thenardier."Pardie!" ejaculated his wife, "where do you suppose it came from?Through the window, of course.""I saw it pass," said Bigrenaille.Thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle."It's in Eponine's handwriting. The devil!"He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her theline written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:--"Quick! The ladder! Let's leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!""Without cutting that man's throat?" asked, the Thenardier woman."We haven't the time.""Through what?" resumed Bigrenaille."Through the window," replied Thenardier. "Since Ponine has thrown thestone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched onthat side."The mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on thefloor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,three times rapidly without uttering a word.This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action onboard ship.The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in thetwinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, andsolidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. Heseemed to be dreaming or praying.As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thenardier cried:"Come! the bourgeoise first!"And he rushed headlong to the window.But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized himroughly by the collar."Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!""After us!" yelled the ruffians."You are children," said Thenardier, "we are losing time. The police areon our heels.""Well," said the ruffians, "let's draw lots to see who shall go downfirst."Thenardier exclaimed:--"Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to wastetime, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! Withwritten names! Thrown into a hat!--""Would you like my hat?" cried a voice on the threshold.All wheeled round. It was Javert.He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a smile.CHAPTER XXI--ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMSAt nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himselfbetween the trees of the Rue de la Barrieredes-Gobelins which facedthe Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begunoperations by opening "his pockets," and dropping into it the two younggirls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to theden. But he had only "caged" Azelma. As for Eponine, she was not at herpost, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. ThenJavert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signalagreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitatedhim. At last, he had grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nestthere, sure of being in "luck," having recognized many of the ruffianswho had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waitingfor the pistol-shot.It will be remembered that he had Marius' pass-key.He had arrived just in the nick of time.The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they hadabandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than asecond, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves inan attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key,another with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers.Thenardier had his knife in his fist. The Thenardier woman snatched upan enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and servedher daughters as an ottoman.[Illustration: Snatched up a Paving Stone  3b8-21-paving-stone]Javert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into theroom, with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath."Halt there," said he. "You shall not go out by the window, you shall gothrough the door. It's less unhealthy. There are seven of you, thereare fifteen of us. Don't let's fall to collaring each other like men ofAuvergne."Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under hisblouse, and put it in Thenardier's hand, whispering in the latter'sear:--"It's Javert. I don't dare fire at that man. Do you dare?""Parbleu!" replied Thenardier."Well, then, fire."Thenardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.Javert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him andcontented himself with saying:--"Come now, don't fire. You'll miss fire."Thenardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire."Didn't I tell you so!" ejaculated Javert.Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert's feet."You're the emperor of the fiends! I surrender.""And you?" Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.They replied:--"So do we."Javert began again calmly:--"That's right, that's good, I said so, you are nice fellows.""I only ask one thing," said Bigrenaille, "and that is, that I may notbe denied tobacco while I am in confinement.""Granted," said Javert.And turning round and calling behind him:--"Come in now!"A squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed with bludgeons andcudgels, rushed in at Javert's summons. They pinioned the ruffians.This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the denwith shadows."Handcuff them all!" shouted Javert."Come on!" cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of whichno one would ever have said: "It is a woman's voice."The Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of thewindow, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.The policemen and agents recoiled.She had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, whowas crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discardedshawl, and she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated thepaving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the pointof hurling a rock."Beware!" she shouted.All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared inthe middle of the garret.The Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowedthemselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and gutturalaccents:--"The cowards!"Javert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thenardierwas devouring with her eyes."Don't come near me," she cried, "or I'll crush you.""What a grenadier!" ejaculated Javert; "you've got a beard like a man,mother, but I have claws like a woman."And he continued to advance.The Thenardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threwherself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert's head. Javertducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off ahuge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across thehovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javert's feet.At the same moment, Javert reached the Thenardier couple. One of hisbig hands descended on the woman's shoulder; the other on the husband'shead."The handcuffs!" he shouted.The policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javert's orderhad been executed.The Thenardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, andat those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed,weeping:--"My daughters!""They are in the jug," said Javert.In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleepbehind the door, and were shaking him:--He awoke, stammering:--"Is it all over, Jondrette?""Yes," replied Javert.The six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved theirspectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked."Keep on your masks," said Javert.And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdamparade, he said to the three "chimney-builders":--"Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!"Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with themeat-axe:--"Good day, Gueulemer!"And to the man with the cudgel:--"Good day, Babet!"And to the ventriloquist:--"Your health, Claquesous."At that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians' prisoner, who, eversince the entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had heldhis head down."Untie the gentleman!" said Javert, "and let no one go out!"That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table,where the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew astamped paper from his pocket, and began to prepare his report.When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary,he raised his eyes:--"Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward."The policemen glanced round them."Well," said Javert, "where is he?"The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father ofUrsule or the Lark, had disappeared.The door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had foundhimself released from his bonds, and while Javert was drawing up hisreport, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness,and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him, todash out of the window.An agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.The rope ladder was still shaking."The devil!" ejaculated Javert between his teeth, "he must have been themost valuable of the lot."CHAPTER XXII--THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWOOn the day following that on which these events took place in the houseon the Boulevard de l'Hopital, a child, who seemed to be coming from thedirection of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley onthe right in the direction of the Barriere de Fontainebleau.Night had fully come.This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the monthof February, and was singing at the top of his voice.At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman wasrummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; thechild jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:--"Hello! And I took it for an enormous, enormous dog!"He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swellof the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: "anenormous, ENORMOUS dog."The old woman straightened herself up in a fury."Nasty brat!" she grumbled. "If I hadn't been bending over, I know wellwhere I would have planted my foot on you."The boy was already far away."Kisss! kisss!" he cried. "After that, I don't think I was mistaken!"The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright,and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, allhollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow's-feet meeting the cornersof her mouth.Her body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. Onewould have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a lightfrom the night.The boy surveyed her."Madame," said he, "does not possess that style of beauty which pleasesme."He then pursued his road, and resumed his song:--               "Le roi Coupdesabot               S'en allait a la chasse,               A la chasse aux corbeaux--"At the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front ofNo. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it withresounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man's shoes thathe was wearing than the child's feet which he owned.In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at thecorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, utteringclamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures."What's this? What's this? Lord God! He's battering the door down! He'sknocking the house down."The kicks continued.The old woman strained her lungs."Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?"All at once she paused.She had recognized the gamin."What! so it's that imp!""Why, it's the old lady," said the lad. "Good day, Bougonmuche. I havecome to see my ancestors."The old woman retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderfulimprovisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness,which was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:--"There's no one here.""Bah!" retorted the boy, "where's my father?""At La Force.""Come, now! And my mother?""At Saint-Lazare.""Well! And my sisters?""At the Madelonettes."The lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma'am Bougon, andsaid:--"Ah!"Then he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman,who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, youngvoice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:--               "Le roi Coupdesabot[31]               S'en allait a la chasse,               A la chasse aux corbeaux,               Monte sur deux echasses.               Quand on passait dessous,               On lui payait deux sous."[THE END OF VOLUME III. "MARIUS"]VOLUME IV.--SAINT-DENIS.[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Four][Illustration: Titlepage Volume Four]THE IDYL IN THE RUE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RUE SAINT-DENISBOOK FIRST.--A FEW PAGES OF HISTORYCHAPTER I--WELL CUT1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with theRevolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking momentsof history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between thosewhich precede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionarygrandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses,the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed andadhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient Frenchformation, appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the stormclouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. These appearancesand disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance.At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descriedshining there.This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning tobe sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principallines even at the present day.We shall make the attempt.The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard todefine, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult,and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at ahalting-place.These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire toconvert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing butrepose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition,to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of greatevents, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, wehave seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We wouldexchange Caesar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. "Whata good little king was he!" We have marched since daybreak, we havereached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our firstchange with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third withBonaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed.Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions whichare sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit,what? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, oftranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the sametime certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door intheir turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, theyare, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society,and they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, factsare the stewards of the household and fouriers[32] who do nothing butprepare lodgings for principles.This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:--At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demandguarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; thisis what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.Princes "grant" them, but in reality, it is the force of things whichgives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuartsdid not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain aglimpse of in 1814.The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, hadthe fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, andthat what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House ofBourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, andthat the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. wasmerely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House ofBourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it shouldplease the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should havefelt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not comefrom it.This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on anill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of atrivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it lookedglum. The people saw this.It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carriedaway before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive thatit had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceivethat it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken;it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The rootsof French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family,but the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under thethrone.The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot inher history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,and the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without theBourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; therehad been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And howshould they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reignedon the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at thebattle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes beenso blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authoritywhich facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension here belowwhich is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right fromon high.A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on theguarantees "granted" in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them.Sad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests;what it termed our encroachments were our rights.When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposingitself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that isto say, believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on itsplan of action, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself upbefore the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested thecollective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty,of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nationthat which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him acitizen.This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called theordinances of July. The Restoration fell.It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile toall forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with italongside.Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calmdiscussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeurin peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free andstrong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples ofEurope. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannonhad had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and CharlesX. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The windceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, thepure light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, andcharming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great principleswhich are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could beseen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality before thelaw, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the press, theaccessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it proceeded until1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in thehands of Providence.The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, buton the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, butwithout authority; their descent into the night was not one of thosesolemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; itwas neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream ofNapoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, andretained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. Theylacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. CharlesX. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cutover into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about imperilledetiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddeneddevoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored theirrace. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning withweapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possessionof so much force that it did not go into a rage. It defended itself,restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government tolaw, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old kingCharles X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. andset him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only withsadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a few men, itwas France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with hervictory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice,before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume duVair after the day of the Barricades:--"It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of thegreat, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflictedfortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards theirPrince in his adversity; but as for me, the fortune of my Kings andespecially of my afflicted Kings, will always be venerable to me."The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we havejust stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded outin the horizon.The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout theentire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, theothers turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush,the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, woundedand stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can becomprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution hadhardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty thehonor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyesof despotic governments, who are always interested in having libertycalumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of beingformidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted orplotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the mosttrembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, amysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of thecollaboration of some one who is working above man.The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. Athing which is full of splendor.Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of beingviolent.Right is the just and the true.The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. Thefact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when mostthoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, andif it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infalliblydestined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps,even monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree ofhideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries,let him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor ademon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact.And he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, thefact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in thepresence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the originof society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with thehumane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the factand the fact into right, that is the task of sages.CHAPTER II--BADLY SEWEDBut the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another.The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste toprepare the shipwreck.The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title ofStatesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming somewhatof a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that whereverthere is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say "theskilful" amounts to saying "the mediocre."In the same way, to say "statesmen" is sometimes equivalent to saying"traitors." If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions likethe Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature isindispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, rightonce firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured,attention must be directed to power.Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but theybegin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, whatis power? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem tohear the murmured objection, and they continue their manoeuvres.According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the maskof necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a peopleafter a revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchicalcontinent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they,peace, that is to say, time to dress our wounds, and to repairthe house, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty conceals thescaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always easy toprocure a dynasty.If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the firstman of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of aking. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make adynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity ina race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.If we place ourselves at the point of view of the "statesmen," aftermaking all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are thequalities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is usefulfor him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his ownperson in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, thathe should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein, thathe should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is tosay, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but byreason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past and be historic;be composed of future and be sympathetic.All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves withfinding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutelyinsisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House ofOrleans.Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which,bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself.Each branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shallbend down to the people.Such is the theory of the skilful.Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success thesound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremblefrom it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augmentthe curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dullthat aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, tocut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, to envelopthe giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very speedily, toimpose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on the treatmentof a convalescent, to dilute the event with the expedient, to offer tospirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion,to take one's precautions against too much success, to garnish therevolution with a shade.1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right.Now, logic knows not the "almost," absolutely as the sun knows not thecandle.Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?Why?Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction.Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will besatiety.The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 afterCharles X.The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of thebourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of thepeople. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chairis not a caste.But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very marchof the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.One is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is notone of the divisions of the social order.Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that partof the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shockof 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference andlaziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumberwhich presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it wasthe halt.The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictorysense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that isto say, repose.The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on thealert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holdsitself on its guard.The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat ofto-morrow.It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man whoshould express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A compositeindividuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in otherterms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of thepast with the future.This man was "already found." His name was Louis Philippe d'Orleans.The 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.He called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took theplace of the Cathedral of Rheims.This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was "the work of1830."When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution becameapparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absoluteright. Absolute right cried: "I protest!" then, terrible to say, itretired into the darkness.CHAPTER III--LOUIS PHILIPPERevolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly andchoose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to thestate of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearlyalways retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them fromfalling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication.Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may bedeceived, and grave errors have been seen.Let us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In theestablishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had beencut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was arare man.The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuatingcircumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been ofblame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; carefulof his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowingthe value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene,peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with hiswife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showingthe conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regularsleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimatedisplays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and,what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speakingthem; an admirable representative of the "middle class," butoutstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellentsense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, countingmost of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race,very particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughlythe first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a SereneHighness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse inpublic, concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; atbottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their ownfancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman,but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family andhis household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardlycold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing at the shortestrange, incapable of rancor and of gratitude, making use without mercy ofsuperiority on mediocrity, clever in getting parliamentary majorities toput in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully underthrones; unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, butwith marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, incountenances, in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France!Incontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family; assumingmore domination than authority and more authority than dignity, adisposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turnseverything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutelyrepudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it preservespolitics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and societyfrom catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious,indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself thelie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain,bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaisewith conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude, to the tastefor the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, tochimeras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the formsof personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes;attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as agrenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of thechances of a European shaking up, and unfitted for great politicaladventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguisinghis will in influence, in order that he might be obeyed as anintelligence rather than as a king; endowed with observation and notwith divination; not very attentive to minds, but knowing men, that isto say requiring to see in order to judge; prompt and penetratinggood sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; drawingincessantly on this memory, his only point of resemblance with Caesar,Alexander, and Napoleon; knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, propernames, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of thecrowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings ofsouls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currentsof consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord withFrance lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing toomuch and not enough; his own first minister; excellent at creating outof the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas;mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order andorganization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, thefounder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne andsomething of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, aprince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasinessof France, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippewill be classed among the eminent men of his century, and would beranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he lovedglory but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of what is great tothe same degree as the feeling for what is useful.Louis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remainedgraceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so by themasses; he pleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; hewore no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man;his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; amixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippewas transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciationand the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinionsmodern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote les Polonois, and hepronounced les Hongrais. He wore the uniform of the national guard, likeCharles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera.Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers; thismade a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went outwith his umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part ofhis aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, somethingof a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; LouisPhilippe no more went about without his lancet, than did Henri IV.without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, thefirst who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to bemade; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign,that which accuses the King; three columns which all give differenttotals. Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a matter ofsecondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed,military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, theRue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the realcountry by the legal country, on half shares with three hundred thousandprivileged persons,--these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused,Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by theEnglish, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, toAbd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,--these are the doingsof the reign; the policy which was more domestic than national was thedoing of the King.As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King'scharge is decreased.This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.Whence arises this fault?We will state it.Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubationof a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid ofeverything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity,which is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in theircivil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilledfirst of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards hisfamily was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy ofadmiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of LouisPhilippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name of her race amongartists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it among poets. She made ofher soul a marble which she named Jeanne d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe'sdaughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: "They are young peoplesuch as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never seen."This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, isthe truth about Louis Philippe.To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction ofthe Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of therevolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein laythe fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more completeadaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the other, and theincarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, hehad in his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He hadbeen proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. InSwitzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France hadsold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gavelessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work andsewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisieenthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage ofMont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was thecompanion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belongedto the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Dantonhad said to him: "Young man!" At the age of four and twenty, in '93,being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box,the trial of Louis XVI., so well named that poor tyrant. The blindclairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King and theKing with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in the fiercecrushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, thepublic wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, thealarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombrebreath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of thosewho condemned as well as of the man condemned,--he had looked on thosethings, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuriesappear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behindLouis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, theterrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows; and there hadlingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices ofthe populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God.The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory waslike a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day,in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, herectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical listof the Constituent Assembly.Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned thepress was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free.The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of thegnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to thelight. History will do justice to him for this loyalty.Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as yet,only in the lower court.The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, hasnot yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definitejudgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanchas himself recently softened his first verdict; Louis Philippe waselected by those two almosts which are called the 221 and 1830, that isto say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution; and in any case,from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself, wecannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above, except with certainreservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in theeyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in thefirst place, the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation;but what we can say, even at the present day, that after making thesereserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he isconsidered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of viewof human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language of ancienthistory, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe theking, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at timeseven to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravestsouvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of thecontinent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhaustedwith fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a deathsentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, consideringit something to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a stillgreater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He obstinatelymaintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed theground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys,those chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes the pile ofsentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was anguish tohim to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he said tothe same witness to whom we have recently referred: "I won seven lastnight." During the early years of his reign, the death penalty wasas good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violencecommitted against the King. The Greve having disappeared with the elderbranch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the nameof the Barriere-Saint-Jacques; "practical men" felt the necessity ofa quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories ofCasimir Perier, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie,over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippeannotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, heexclaimed: "What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I might havepardoned!" On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered byhis ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who isone of the most generous figures of our day: "His pardon is granted; itonly remains for me to obtain it." Louis Philippe was as gentle as LouisIX. and as kindly as Henri IV.Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls,the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, byothers, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the presentday, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor beforehistory; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently andabove all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a deadman is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of thesame shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly tobe feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: "This oneflattered the other."CHAPTER IV--CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATIONAt the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point ofpenetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelopthe beginning of Louis Philippe's reign, it was necessary that thereshould be no equivoque, and it became requisite that this book shouldoffer some explanation with regard to this king.Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authoritywithout violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of arevolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of theRevolution, but in which he, the Duc d'Orleans, exercised no personalinitiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to havebeen elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had nottaken it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it; convinced,wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was inaccordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordancewith duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it ingood conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect goodfaith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amountof terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on theKing nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash ofelements. The ocean defends the water, the hurricane defends theair, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends the people; therelative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which is therepublic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that which constitutesits suffering to-day will constitute its safety later on; and, in anycase, those who combat are not to be blamed; one of the two parties isevidently mistaken; the right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, ontwo shores at once, with one foot on the republic, and one in Royalty;it is indivisible, and all on one side; but those who are in error areso sincerely; a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is aruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone theseformidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests may be,human irresponsibility is mingled with them.Let us complete this exposition.The government of 1830 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, itwas obliged to fight to-day.Hardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague movementsof traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking insolidity.Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on thepreceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and frombeing concealed it became patent.The Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside ofFrance by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, as we havesaid.God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure textwritten in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of it;translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of nonsense.Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most sagacious, thecalmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive withtheir text, the task has long been completed; there are already twentytranslations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party,and from each misinterpretation a faction; and each party thinks that italone has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses thelight.Power itself is often a faction.There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they arethe old parties.For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, thinkthat revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has theright to revolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the onewho revolts is not the people; it is the king. Revolution is preciselythe contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome,contains within itself its legitimacy, which false revolutionistssometimes dishonor, but which remains even when soiled, which surviveseven when stained with blood.Revolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. Arevolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because itmust be that it is.None the less did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errorsmake excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its vulnerablespot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked thisrevolution in its royalty. They shouted to it: "Revolution, why thisking?" Factions are blind men who aim correctly.This cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming fromthem, this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists wasclearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people.The enraged democracy reproached it with this.Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future, theestablishment of July struggled. It represented the minute atloggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the otherhand with eternal right.In addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and hadbecome a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. Tokeep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony establishedcontrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. From this secretconflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was born armed peace,that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of theEuropean cabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty of July rearedup, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of Europeancabinets. Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushedon in France by progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterersin Europe. After having been towed, it undertook to tow.Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education,penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery,production, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights ofcapital, the rights of labor,--all these questions were multiplied abovesociety, a terrible slope.Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement becamemanifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation.The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another manner, butquite as much.Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people,traversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them withindescribably vague epileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated,others united in families and almost in communion, turned over socialquestions in a pacific but profound manner; impassive miners, whotranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, hardlydisturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caughtglimpses.This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitatedepoch.These men left to political parties the question of rights, theyoccupied themselves with the question of happiness.The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract fromsociety.They raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry,of commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, suchas it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal bythe agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in amanner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law,patiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. These menwho grouped themselves under different appellations, but who may all bedesignated by the generic title of socialists, endeavored to pierce thatrock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity.From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their worksembraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the FrenchRevolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.The reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do nothere treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, thequestions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them.All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonicvisions, revery and mysticism being cast aside, can be reduced to twoprincipal problems.First problem: To produce wealth.Second problem: To share it.The first problem contains the question of work.The second contains the question of salary.In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.From the proper employment of forces results public power.From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.By a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution mustbe understood.From these two things combined, the public power without, individualhappiness within, results social prosperity.Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nationgreat.England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealthadmirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete onone side only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence,monstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for therest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly,feudalism, born from toil itself. A false and dangerous situation, whichsates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the Statein the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur inwhich are combined all the material elements and into which no moralelement enters.Communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem.They are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partitionabolishes emulation; and consequently labor. It is a partition madeby the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is thereforeimpossible to pause over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth isnot the same thing as dividing it.The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. Thetwo problems must be combined and made but one.Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you willbe England. You will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, likeEngland, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will dieby an act of violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as Englandwill fall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merelyselfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either avirtue or an idea.It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, wedesignate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchiessuperposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nationsalways have our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will liveagain; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, isimmortal. That said, we continue.Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble bythe strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man whois making his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust,mathematically and fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous andcompulsory education with the growth of childhood, and make of sciencethe base of manliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at oneand the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men, renderproperty democratic, not by abolishing it, but by making it universal,so that every citizen, without exception, may be a proprietor, an easiermatter than is generally supposed; in two words, learn how to producewealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once moral andmaterial greatness; and you will be worthy to call yourself France.This is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which havegone astray; that is what it sought in facts, that is what it sketchedout in minds.Efforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts!These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseennecessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confusedevidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to becreated, which shall be in accord with the old world without too muchdisaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which itbecame necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition ofprogress transparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, thecompetitions to be brought into equilibrium around him, his faith inthe Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of thevague acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain ofhis race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people, hisown honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there weremoments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by thedifficulties of being a king.He felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not,nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually drawingnearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over ideas;a shade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had beenhastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience ofthe honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfortof that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spiritstrembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm.The electric tension was such that at certain instants, the first comer,a stranger, brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again.At intervals, deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formedas to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening.The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Princede Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus asParis did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Princeand giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas,behind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel inPortugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand overBologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no oneknew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin,irritated glances watching France narrowly all over Europe, England, asuspected ally, ready to give a push to that which was tottering and tohurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage sheltering itselfbehind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lyserased from the King's carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame,Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined, Benjamin Constant dead inindigence, Casimir Perier dead in the exhaustion of his power; politicaland social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of thekingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil;at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the sameglare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people;the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse de Berry inla Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the sombre roarof tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.CHAPTER V--FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORESTowards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. Thefermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partialrevolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed,but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlyingconflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could becaught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of apossible revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye onthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine.The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning itsebullition.[Illustration: A Street Orator  4b1-5-street-orator]The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union ofthe two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave andstormy.The government was there purely and simply called in question. Therepeople publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet.There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that theywould hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and "that theywould fight without counting the number of the enemy." This engagementonce entered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop "assumeda sonorous tone," and said, "You understand! You have sworn!"Sometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first floor,and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made theinitiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to thefathers of families. That was the formula.In the tap-rooms, "subversive" pamphlets were read. They treated thegovernment with contempt, says a secret report of that time.Words like the following could be heard there:--"I don't know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the dayuntil two hours beforehand." One workman said: "There are three hundredof us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred andfifty francs with which to procure powder and shot."Another said: "I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two.In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. Withtwenty-five thousand men we can face them." Another said: "I don't sleepat night, because I make cartridges all night." From time to time,men "of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats" came and "causedembarrassment," and with the air of "command," shook hands with the mostimportant, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes.Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: "The plot is ripe, thematter is arranged." "It was murmured by all who were there," to borrowthe very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation wassuch that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop:"We have no arms!" One of his comrades replied: "The soldiers have!"thus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamationto the army in Italy: "When they had anything of a more secret nature onhand," adds one report, "they did not communicate it to each other." Itis not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said.These reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, therewere never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were alwaysthe same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room wasso full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither throughenthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way to theirwork. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some ofthese wine-shops who embraced new-comers.Other expressive facts came to light.A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark:"Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you."Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue deCharonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons inthe Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of woodenbroadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removedfrom the foils.A workman said: "There are twenty-five of us, but they don't counton me, because I am looked upon as a machine." Later on, that machinebecame Quenisset.The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strangeand indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps saidto another woman: "For a long time, there has been a strong force busymaking cartridges." In the open street, proclamation could be seenaddressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of theseproclamations was signed: Burtot, wine-merchant.One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italianaccent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the MarcheLenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which seemed to emanate froman occult power. Groups formed around him, and applauded.The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected andnoted down. "--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, ourbill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison."--"The breakdownwhich has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us manymediums."--"The future of nations is being worked out in our obscureranks."--"Here are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution orcounter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either ininertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is thequestion. There is no other."--"On the day when we cease to suit you,break us, but up to that day, help us to march on." All this in broaddaylight.Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of thepeople by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, apasser-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of theRue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted: "I am a Babouvist!" But beneathBabeuf, the people scented Gisquet.Among other things, this man said:--"Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly andtreacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preachesrevolution, it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, androyalist so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beastswith feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboringclasses.""Silence, citizen spy!" cried an artisan.This shout put an end to the discourse.Mysterious incidents occurred.At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a "very welldressed man," who said to him: "Whither are you bound, citizen?" "Sir,"replied the workingman, "I have not the honor of your acquaintance." "Iknow you very well, however." And the man added: "Don't be alarmed, Iam an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quitefaithful. You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed onyou." Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying: "Weshall meet again soon."The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, notonly in the wine-shops, but in the street."Get yourself received very soon," said a weaver to a cabinet-maker."Why?""There is going to be a shot to fire."Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught withevident Jacquerie:--"Who governs us?""M. Philippe.""No, it is the bourgeoisie."The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word Jacquerie in abad sense. The Jacques were the poor.On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as theypassed by: "We have a good plan of attack."Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four menwho were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere du Trone:--"Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris anymore."Who was the he? Menacing obscurity."The principal leaders," as they said in the faubourg, held themselvesapart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shopnear the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Societyaid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving asintermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about theseleaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance ofthis reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:--"Who was your leader?""I knew of none and I recognized none."There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes idlereports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the groundon which a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuillyfound on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were stilllegible the following lines:--The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sectionsfor the different societies.And, as a postscript:--We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere,No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of agunsmith in that court. The section owns no arms.What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to hisneighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up anotherpaper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of which wereproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching tothese strange documents:--[Illustration: Code Table 4b1-5 page 26] +------------------------------------------------------------+ | Q | C | D | E | Learn this list by heart.  After so doing | | | | | | you will tear it up.  The men admitted | | | | | | will do the same when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders to them. | | | | | | Health and Fraternity, | | | | | | u og a fe L. | +------------------------------------------------------------+It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of thisfind at the time, learned the significance of those four capitalletters: quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs [scouts], andthe sense of the letters: u og a fe, which was a date, and meant April15th, 1832. Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed byvery characteristic notes. Thus: Q. Bannerel. 8 guns, 83 cartridges. Asafe man.--C. Boubiere. 1 pistol, 40 cartridges.--D. Rollet. 1 foil,1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.--E. Tessier. 1 sword, 1 cartridge-box.Exact.--Terreur. 8 guns. Brave, etc.Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a thirdpaper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, this sort ofenigmatical list:--          Unite:  Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.          Barra.  Soize.  Salle-au-Comte.          Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?          J. J. R.          Caius Gracchus.          Right of revision.  Dufond.  Four.          Fall of the Girondists.  Derbac.  Maubuee.          Washington.  Pinson.  1 pistol, 86 cartridges.          Marseillaise.          Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.          Hoche.          Marceau.  Plato.  Arbre-Sec.          Warsaw.  Tilly, crier of the Populaire.The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew itssignificance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature ofthe sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rightsof Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. To-day,when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history,we may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation of theSociety of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the datewhen this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft.Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according to writtennotes, material facts begin to make their appearance.In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, therewere seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwiseand in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this samegray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which waswritten the following:--           Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . .  12 ounces.           Sulphur   . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.           Charcoal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces and a half.           Water     . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smellof powder.A mason returning from his day's work, left behind him a little packageon a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken tothe police station. It was opened, and in it were found two printeddialogues, signed Lahautiere, a song entitled: "Workmen, band together,"and a tin box full of cartridges.One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see howwarm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.In a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise and the Barrieredu Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing,discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, abag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation ofcartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder,and a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented evident traces ofmelted lead.Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at fiveo'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, whowas afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himselfkilled in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near hisbed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act ofpreparing.Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meetbetween the Barriere Picpus and the Barriere Charenton in a little lanebetween two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a "Jeude Siam."[33] One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it tothe other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the perspirationof his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the pistol and addedmore powder to what was already in the pan. Then the two men parted.A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affairof April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges andtwenty-four flints.The government one day received a warning that arms and two hundredthousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. Onthe following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. Theremarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to seize asingle one.An intercepted letter read: "The day is not far distant when, withinfour hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms."All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. Theapproaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face ofthe government. No singularity was lacking to this still subterraneancrisis, which was already perceptible. The bourgeois talked peaceably tothe working-classes of what was in preparation. They said: "How is therising coming along?" in the same tone in which they would have said:"How is your wife?"A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: "Well, when are yougoing to make the attack?"Another shop-keeper said:--"The attack will be made soon.""I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now thereare twenty-five thousand." He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered asmall pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs.Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris norin France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Likethose membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in thehuman body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over thecountry. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which wasat the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights ofMan, which also dated from one of the orders of the day: Pluviose, Year40 of the republican era, which was destined to survive even the mandateof the Court of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and whichdid not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like thefollowing:--     Pikes.     Tocsin.     Signal cannon.     Phrygian cap.     January 21.     The beggars.     The vagabonds.     Forward march.     Robespierre.     Level.     Ca Ira.The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. Thesewere impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. Otherassociations sought to recruit themselves from the great mothersocieties. The members of sections complained that they were tornasunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization ofthe Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press,for individual liberty, for the instruction of the people againstindirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was dividedinto three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers.Then the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a militaryfooting, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty bya sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; there were never more thanfive men who knew each other. Creation where precaution is combined withaudacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of Venice.The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Societyof Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred aboutamong these the republican affiliations. It was denounced and repudiatedthere.The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons,Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights ofMan, the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary societywhich was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with theFaubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than thefaubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of theSeven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallyingpoints for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B Caffiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix,met, as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembledalso, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the RueMondetour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Otherswere as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldnessfrom these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of theulterior prosecutions: "Where was this meeting held?" "In the Rue de laPaix." "At whose house?" "In the street." "What sections were there?""Only one." "Which?" "The Manuel section." "Who was its leader?""I." "You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course ofattacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?" "Fromthe central committee."The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was provedsubsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, and Epinard. Theycounted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, onthe thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy andin the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, apole surmounted by a red cap.Such was the situation.The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population,as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and madeit felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled likean ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees, wasquivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everythingwas in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, ofthe regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yetsombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant distress hiddenunder attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It isparticularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it isdangerous to have extremes meet.The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for itreceived the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In timesof revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it dealsrebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to thehighest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt toexplode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting thefall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chasedby the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the FaubourgSaint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the verygates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.The wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more thanonce drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possesshistorical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated theremore on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatusof the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. Thecabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of MontAventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating withthe profound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almosttripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the sibylline wine.The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionaryagitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popularsovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like anyother; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it asof the blind cyclops, Ingens.In '93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil,according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leapedforth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroicbands.Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in theearly days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, withuplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris inan uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, anend to tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for thechild, social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity,bread for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress;and that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terriblewise, driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist,a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages ofcivilization.They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only withfear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemedbarbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask ofnight.Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, butferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling,embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in whiteplumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows ona velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanorand the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right,of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war,glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, andthe scaffold. For our part, if we were forced to make a choice betweenthe barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, weshould choose the barbarians.But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicularfall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope.God takes care of that. God's whole policy consists in rendering slopesless steep.CHAPTER VI--ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTSIt was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possiblecatastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census.All were present at a secret meeting at the Cafe Musain.Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical butsignificant metaphors:--"It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we maycount. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do noharm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have morechance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when thereare none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of usare there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose.Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We mustgo over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast.This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see thepolytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day is Wednesday.Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere, will you not? Combeferrehas promised me to go to Picpus. There is a perfect swarm and anexcellent one there. Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, themasons are growing lukewarm; you will bring us news from the lodge ofthe Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore. Joly will go to Dupuytren's clinicallecture, and feel the pulse of the medical school. Bossuet will take alittle turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates. I willtake charge of the Cougourde myself.""That arranges everything," said Courfeyrac."No.""What else is there?""A very important thing.""What is that?" asked Courfeyrac."The Barriere du Maine," replied Enjolras.Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection, then heresumed:--"At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, andjourneymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic family,but liable to cool off. I don't know what has been the matter withthem for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They arebecoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There isurgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, butwith firmness. They meet at Richefeu's. They are to be found therebetween twelve and one o'clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow.For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a goodfellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one forthe Barriere du Maine. I have no one.""What about me?" said Grantaire. "Here am I.""You?""I.""You indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown coldin the name of principle!""Why not?""Are you good for anything?""I have a vague ambition in that direction," said Grantaire."You do not believe in everything.""I believe in you.""Grantaire will you do me a service?""Anything. I'll black your boots.""Well, don't meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from yourabsinthe.""You are an ingrate, Enjolras.""You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine! You capable of it!""I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres, of crossing the PlaceSaint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of takingthe Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rued'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me theConseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries, of stridingacross the boulevard, of following the Chaussee du Maine, of passingthe barrier, and entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. My shoes arecapable of that.""Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu's?""Not much. We only address each other as thou.""What will you say to them?""I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles.""You?""I. But I don't receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. Ihave read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitutionof the year Two by heart. 'The liberty of one citizen ends where theliberty of another citizen begins.' Do you take me for a brute? I havean old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, thesovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a Hebertist. Ican talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch inhand.""Be serious," said Enjolras."I am wild," replied Grantaire.Enjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man whohas taken a resolution."Grantaire," he said gravely, "I consent to try you. You shall go to theBarriere du Maine."Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Cafe Musain. He wentout, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to put on aRobespierre waistcoat."Red," said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then,with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points ofthe waistcoat across his breast.And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:--"Be easy."He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Cafe Musain wasdeserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his owndirection, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved theCougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on theplain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous inthat side of Paris.As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situationin review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. Whenfacts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily,the slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whencearises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous upliftingbeneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the momentwas at hand. The people were again taking possession of right, andwhat a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically takingpossession of France and saying to the world: "The sequel to-morrow!"Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at thatmoment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed,in his own mind, with Combeferre's philosophical and penetratingeloquence, Feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash,Bahorel's smile, Jean Prouvaire's melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet'ssarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere atonce. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort.This was well. This made him think of Grantaire."Hold," said he to himself, "the Barriere du Maine will not take me farout of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu's? Let us havea look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on."One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolrasreached the Richefeu smoking-room.He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door fallto and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with tables,men, and smoke.A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by anothervoice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Annetable, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He washammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:--"Double-six.""Fours.""The pig! I have no more.""You are dead. A two.""Six.""Three.""One.""It's my move.""Four points.""Not much.""It's your turn.""I have made an enormous mistake.""You are doing well.""Fifteen.""Seven more.""That makes me twenty-two." [Thoughtfully, "Twenty-two!"]"You weren't expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at thebeginning, the whole play would have been changed.""A two again.""One.""One! Well, five.""I haven't any.""It was your play, I believe?""Yes.""Blank.""What luck he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long revery.] Two.""One.""Neither five nor one. That's bad for you.""Domino.""Plague take it!"BOOK SECOND.--EPONINECHAPTER I--THE LARK'S MEADOWMarius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whosetrack he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building,bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than Marius alsoglided out of the house. It was only nine o'clock in the evening. Mariusbetook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbableinhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de laVerrerie "for political reasons"; this quarter was one where, at thatepoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac:"I have come to sleep with you." Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off hisbed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:"There."At seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel,paid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, had his books,his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on ahand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javertreturned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioningMarius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma'amBougon, who answered: "Moved away!"Ma'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accompliceof the robbers who had been seized the night before. "Who would everhave said it?" she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, "a youngman like that, who had the air of a girl!"Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The firstwas, that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, soclose at hand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development,a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wickedrich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he did not wishto figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability, and bebrought in to testify against Thenardier.Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, wasafraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the timeof the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but withoutsuccess.A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He hadlearned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of thecourts, that Thenardier was in close confinement. Every Monday,Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's office of La Force forThenardier.As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs fromCourfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowedmoney. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyracwho lent and to Thenardier who received them. "To whom can they go?"thought Courfeyrac. "Whence can this come to me?" Thenardier askedhimself.Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through atrap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his lifewas again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for amoment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whomhe loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings,who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at thevery moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, agust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty andtruth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. Noconjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thoughthe knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. Andwhat was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding fromthe police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in thevicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probablethat that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So hedisguised himself? That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Whyhad he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he not,the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thenardierthought that he recognized? Thenardier might have been mistaken. Theseformed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, detractednothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg.Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and nightover his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could notstir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost theinstincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame whichburns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams without.But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. He neversaid to himself: "What if I were to go to such a place? What if I wereto try such and such a thing?" The girl whom he could no longer callUrsule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what directionhe should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two words;absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again;he still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it.To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close tohim, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long beforethis, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous thandiscontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easyto get rid of, and difficult to take up again.A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses.It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimessevere, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which correctsthe over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there,binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too muchdreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself tofall entirely from thought into revery! He thinks that he can re-ascendwith equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the samething. Error!Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. Toreplace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food.Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion hadsupervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeraswithout object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one's self exceptfor the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous andstagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.This is a law. Man, in a state of revery, is generally prodigal andslack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for ifenervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poorman who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resourcesare exhausted, needs crop up.Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well asthe most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of twoholds, suicide or crime.By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out tothrow one's self in the water.Excess of revery breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyesfixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seemsstrange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles inthe darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more itbeams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon;the star of the inner night. She--that was Marius' whole thought. Hemeditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious that his old coatwas becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was growing old,that his shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, that hisboots were giving out, and he said to himself: "If I could but see heronce again before I die!"One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that herglance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she didknow his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place,she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking ofhim as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hourssuch as are experienced by every heart that loves, though he had noreasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy,he said to himself: "It is her thoughts that are coming to me!" Then headded: "Perhaps my thoughts reach her also."This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, wassufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope,into his soul. From time to time, especially at that evening hour whichis the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, themost impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain,to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else. He called this"writing to her."It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite thecontrary. He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmlytowards any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightednessand rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed by a calm and real, althoughpeculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferentdeeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sortof honest dejection and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, whichwas almost wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof and soaredon high.In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, andevery moment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity, andof destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God hasgiven a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not viewedthe things of this world and the heart of man under this double lighthas seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.The soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.However, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. Itmerely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to betraversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. He thought thathe already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss."What!" he repeated to himself, "shall I not see her again before then!"When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on oneside and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reachthe Rue de la Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little while beforearriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort offield which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of theboulevards of Paris, where Ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down.There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a greenmeadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter ragsdrying in the wind, and an old market-gardener's house, built in thetime of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormerwindows, dilapidated palisades, a little water amid poplar-trees,women, voices, laughter; on the horizon the Pantheon, the pole ofthe Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grace, black, squat, fantastic, amusing,magnificent, and in the background, the severe square crests of thetowers of Notre Dame.As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cartor wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.It chanced that Marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot ofground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard,a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty ofthe place, asked this passer-by:--"What is the name of this spot?"The person replied: "It is the Lark's meadow."And he added: "It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry."But after the word "Lark" Marius heard nothing more. These suddencongealments in the state of revery, which a single word suffices toevoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around anidea, and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths ofMarius' melancholy.--"Stop," said he with a sort of unreasoning stuporpeculiar to these mysterious asides, "this is her meadow. I shall knowwhere she lives now."It was absurd, but irresistible.And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.CHAPTER II--EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONSJavert's triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not beenso.In the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javerthad not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who fleesis more suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that thispersonage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would beno less fine a prize for the authorities.And then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.Another opportunity of laying hands on that "devil's dandy" must bewaited for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Eponine as she stoodon the watch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off,preferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhanneswith the father. It was well that he did so. He was free. As forEponine, Javert had caused her to be seized; a mediocre consolation.Eponine had joined Azelma at Les Madelonettes.And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of theprincipal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known howthis had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants "couldnot understand it at all." He had converted himself into vapor, he hadslipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices ofthe carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that theywere able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was noClaquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. HadClaquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had therebeen unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belongto the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric withinfraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime andhis hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations, andwould have bristled up against such compromises; but his squad includedother inspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he,perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the secrets of thePrefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that he might makea very good agent. It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and anadmirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling termswith the night. These double-edged rascals do exist. However that maybe, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found again. Javert appearedto be more irritated than amazed at this.As for Marius, "that booby of a lawyer," who had probably becomefrightened, and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached verylittle importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at anytime. But was he a lawyer after all?The investigation had begun.The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men ofthe band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that hewould chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue duPetit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, andthe eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideouscourtyard, called the court of the Batiment-Neuf (New Building), whichthe administration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robberscalled the Fosseaux-Lions (The Lion's Ditch), on that wall covered withscales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs,near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of theducal residence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians,there could still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughlycarved in the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature:--                       BRUJON, 1811.The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.The latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeauhouse, was a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a bewilderedand plaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that themagistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagneyard than in close confinement.Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the handsof justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle asthat. To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning onanother crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, andwho toil, none the less, on a new work in their studios.Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seenstanding by the hour together in front of the sutler's window in theCharlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of priceswhich began with: garlic, 62 centimes, and ended with: cigar, 5centimes. Or he passed his time in trembling, chattering his teeth,saying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight andtwenty beds in the fever ward was vacant.All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered thatBrujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissionsexecuted by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name,but in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him in allfifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of theprison corporal.Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissionsposted in the convict's parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous couldbe analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Pantheon, tensous; one to Val-de-Grace, fifteen sous; and one to the Barriere deGrenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the wholetariff. Now, at the Pantheon, at the Val-de-Grace, and at the Barrierede Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtableprowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarre, Glorieux, anex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police wasdirected by this incident. It was thought that these men were membersof Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer, had beencaptured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed,not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the street,must have contained information with regard to some crime that had beenplotted. They were in possession of other indications; they laid hand onthe three prowlers, and supposed that they had circumvented some one orother of Brujon's machinations.About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as thesuperintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitoryin the Batiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box--thiswas the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed theirduties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all theboxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories--a watchman looked throughthe peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed andwriting something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered,Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were not able toseize what he had written. The police learned nothing further about it.What is certain is, that on the following morning, a "postilion"was flung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions' Ditch, over thefive-story building which separated the two court-yards.What prisoners call a "postilion" is a pellet of bread artisticallymoulded, which is sent into Ireland, that is to say, over the roofs of aprison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from oneland to another; into Ireland. This little pellet falls in the yard. Theman who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to someprisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, heforwards the note to its destination; if it is a keeper, or one of theprisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in thegalleys, the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police.On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the personto whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary confinement.This person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of PatronMinette.The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lineswere written:--"Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden."This is what Brujon had written the night before.In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note onfrom La Force to the Salpetriere, to a "good friend" whom he had and whowas shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to anotherwoman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspectedby the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name thereader has already seen, had relations with the Thenardier, which willbe described in detail later on, and she could, by going to see Eponine,serve as a bridge between the Salpetriere and Les Madelonettes.It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wantingin the investigation directed against Thenardier in the matter of hisdaughters, Eponine and Azelma were released. When Eponine came out,Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed herBrujon's note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.Eponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought toMagnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnontransmitted to Babet's mistress in the Salpetriere. A biscuit, in theshady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met inthe circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the otheron his way from it:--"Well?" asked Brujon, "the Rue P.?""Biscuit," replied Babet. Thus did the foetus of crime engendered byBrujon in La Force miscarry.This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectlydistinct from Brujon's programme. The reader will see what they were.Often when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying quiteanother.CHAPTER III--APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUFMarius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encounteredFather Mabeuf by chance.While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may becalled the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, wherethe happy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on hisside.The Flora of Cauteretz no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigohad not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which hada bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants whichlove shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become discouraged. Hehad obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a good exposure,to make his trials with indigo "at his own expense." For this purpose hehad pawned his copperplates of the Flora. He had reduced his breakfastto two eggs, and he left one of these for his old servant, to whom hehad paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And often his breakfastwas his only meal. He no longer smiled with his infantile smile, he hadgrown morose and no longer received visitors. Marius did well not todream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf was on hisway to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man passedeach other on the Boulevard de l'Hopital. They did not speak, and onlyexchanged a melancholy sign of the head. A heart-breaking thing it isthat there comes a moment when misery looses bonds! Two men who havebeen friends become two chance passers-by.Royal the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books,his garden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness,pleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for hisliving. He said to himself: "When I shall have made my balls of blueing,I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop,I will put my Flora in vogue again with trickery, plenty of money andadvertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, acopy of Pierre de Medine's Art de Naviguer, with wood-cuts, edition of1655." In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, andat night he returned home to water his garden, and to read his books. Atthat epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.One evening he had a singular apparition.He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. MotherPlutarque, whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dinedon a bone, on which a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that hehad found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturnedstone post, which took the place of a bench in his garden.Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sortof large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch onthe ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in thehutch, but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,--the remains ofthe winter's provision.M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid ofhis glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which,a serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidityrendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certaindegree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of PresidentDelancre, De l'inconstance des Demons; the other was a quarto by Mutorde la Rubaudiere, Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de laBievre. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more,because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins informer times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and toblacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he heldin his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others amagnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days ofheat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks werebending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed water,the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of thosepersons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all day overhis indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose, laidhis books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with totteringfootsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could noteven draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round and cast aglance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of manbeneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised tobe as arid as the day had been."Stars everywhere!" thought the old man; "not the tiniest cloud! Not adrop of water!"And his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon hisbreast.He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:--"A tear of dew! A little pity!"He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.At that moment, he heard a voice saying:--"Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?"At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audiblein the hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,slender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly athim. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had justblossomed forth from the twilight.Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we havesaid, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, thisbeing, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, hadunhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled thewatering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had barefeet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-bedsdistributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on theleaves filled Father Mabeuf's soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him thatthe rhododendron was happy now.The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. Shewatered the whole garden.There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, whereher outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and withher fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in hiseyes, and laid his hand on her brow."God will bless you," said he, "you are an angel since you take care ofthe flowers.""No," she replied. "I am the devil, but that's all the same to me."The old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing herresponse:--"What a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do nothingfor you!""You can do something," said she."What?""Tell me where M. Marius lives."The old man did not understand. "What Monsieur Marius?"He raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that hadvanished."A young man who used to come here."In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory."Ah! yes--" he exclaimed. "I know what you mean. Wait! MonsieurMarius--the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,--or rather, he nolonger lives,--ah well, I don't know."As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and hecontinued:--"Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes inthe direction of the Glaciere, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark.Go there. It is not hard to meet him."When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any onethere; the girl had disappeared.He was decidedly terrified."Really," he thought, "if my garden had not been watered, I should thinkthat she was a spirit."An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fellasleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that fabulous birdwhich changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little bylittle assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he saidto himself in a bewildered way:--"In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudiere narrates of thegoblins. Could it have been a goblin?"CHAPTER IV--AN APPARITION TO MARIUSSome days after this visit of a "spirit" to Farmer Mabeuf, onemorning,--it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed thehundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Thenardier--Marius had put thiscoin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk's office, hehad gone "to take a little stroll," in the hope that this would make himwork on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, heseated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribblesome translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning intoFrench a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savignycontroversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried towrite one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rosefrom his chair, saying: "I shall go out. That will put me in spirits."And off he went to the Lark's meadow.There he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny andGans.He returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed;there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads whichwere broken in his brain; then he said to himself: "I will not go outto-morrow. It prevents my working." And he went out every day.He lived in the Lark's meadow more than in Courfeyrac's lodgings. Thatwas his real address: Boulevard de la Sante, at the seventh tree fromthe Rue Croulebarbe.That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself onthe parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetratedthe freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.He was dreaming of "Her." And his meditation turning to a reproach, fellback upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his paralysisof soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which was growingmore dense every moment before him, to such a point that he no longereven saw the sun.Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas whichwas not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and hehad no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholyabsorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him,beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelinsbeating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering andsinging in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, thecareless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other, thesound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost reflect,were two cheerful sounds.All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiarvoice saying:--"Come! Here he is!"He raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come tohim one morning, the elder of the Thenardier daughters, Eponine; he knewher name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier,two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take. She hadaccomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress.She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so resolutelyentered his chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the holeswere larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice,the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, andvacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in her facethat indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in aprison adds to wretchedness.She had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia throughhaving gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet's madness, but because shehad slept in the loft of some stable.And in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, Oyouth!In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joyin her livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.She stood for several moments as though incapable of speech."So I have met you at last!" she said at length. "Father Mabeuf wasright, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you onlyknew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me out!seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had notreached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I havehunted for you! These six weeks! So you don't live down there any more?""No," said Marius."Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs aredisagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats likethis! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don't knowwhat. It isn't true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, theygo to the Luxembourg, in front of the chateau, where there is the mostsun, and they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I once carried a letter toa baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do youlive now?"Marius made no reply."Ah!" she went on, "you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up foryou."She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:--"You don't seem glad to see me."Marius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, thenexclaimed:--"But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!""What?" demanded Marius. "What do you mean?""Ah! you used to call me thou," she retorted."Well, then, what dost thou mean?"She bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sortof inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision."So much the worse, I don't care. You have a melancholy air, I want youto be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see yousmile and hear you say: 'Ah, well, that's good.' Poor Mr. Marius! youknow? You promised me that you would give me anything I like--""Yes! Only speak!"She looked Marius full in the eye, and said:--"I have the address."Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart."What address?""The address that you asked me to get!"She added, as though with an effort:--"The address--you know very well!""Yes!" stammered Marius."Of that young lady."This word uttered, she sighed deeply.Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seizedher hand distractedly."Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Whereis it?""Come with me," she responded. "I don't know the street or number verywell; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the housewell, I will take you to it."She withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rentthe heart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in hisintoxicated and ecstatic state:--"Oh! how glad you are!"A cloud swept across Marius' brow. He seized Eponine by the arm:--"Swear one thing to me!""Swear!" said she, "what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?"And she laughed."Your father! promise me, Eponine! Swear to me that you will not givethis address to your father!"She turned to him with a stupefied air."Eponine! How do you know that my name is Eponine?""Promise what I tell you!"But she did not seem to hear him."That's nice! You have called me Eponine!"Marius grasped both her arms at once."But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am sayingto you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this address thatyou know!""My father!" said she. "Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. He's in closeconfinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!""But you do not promise me!" exclaimed Marius."Let go of me!" she said, bursting into a laugh, "how you do shake me!Yes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? Iwill not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?""Nor to any one?" said Marius."Nor to any one.""Now," resumed Marius, "take me there.""Immediately?""Immediately.""Come along. Ah! how pleased he is!" said she.After a few steps she halted."You are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead,and follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice young man like youmust not be seen with a woman like me."No tongue can express all that lay in that word, woman, thus pronouncedby that child.She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joinedher. She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him:--"By the way, you know that you promised me something?"Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was thefive francs intended for Thenardier the father. He took them and laidthem in Eponine's hand.She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed athim with a gloomy air."I don't want your money," said she.BOOK THIRD.--THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMETCHAPTER I--THE HOUSE WITH A SECRETAbout the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliamentof Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that periodthe grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeoisconcealed them, had "a little house" built in the FaubourgSaint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called RuePlumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as Combat desAnimaux.This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on theground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen down stairs,a boudoir up stairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by agarden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was aboutan acre and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen bypassers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, andat the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms anda cellar, a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nursein case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a maskeddoor which opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow, paved windingcorridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hiddenwith wonderful art, and lost as it were between garden enclosures andcultivated land, all of whose angles and detours it followed, ended inanother door, also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a leagueaway, almost in another quarter, at the solitary extremity of the Rue duBabylone.Through this the chief justice entered, so that even those who werespying on him and following him would merely have observed that thejustice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, andwould never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to goto the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistratehad been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property,and consequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in littleparcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoiningthe corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thoughtthey had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect thelong, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds andtheir orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probablethat the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great dealabout the chief justice.The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted andfurnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashionedon the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had somethingdiscreet, coquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of loveand magistracy.This house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existencefifteen years ago. In '93 a coppersmith had purchased the house withthe idea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; thenation made him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished thecoppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell slowlyto ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does notcommunicate life. It had remained fitted with its old furniture, wasalways for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passedthrough the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegiblebit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might havenoticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on thefirst floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows hadshort curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presentedhimself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course,the back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. Hehad had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired.The house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnishedwith the justice's old fitting; the new tenant had ordered somerepairs, had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced thepaving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs,missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows,and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderlymaid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slippingin than like a man who is entering his own house. The neighbors did notgossip about him, for the reason that there were no neighbors.This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette.The servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had savedfrom the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, astammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decidedJean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the nameof M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has beenrelated heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt thanThenardier to recognize Jean Valjean.Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What hadhappened?Nothing had happened.It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, sohappy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette everyday, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more,he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that shewas his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would lastindefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being theretogently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth theuniverse for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, andthat she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and thathe should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separationwas possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. Heinterrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness werereally his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, ofthe happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating andstealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this childhad a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her inadvance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, underthe pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of herignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocationgerminate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lieto God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this someday, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come tohate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest,but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it wasnecessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years' sojournbetween these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyedor dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men.He had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognizehim now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself,and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reasonthat he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger incomparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudentand taking his precautions.As for Cosette's education, it was almost finished and complete.His determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not longin presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told herthat, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother,which permitted him henceforth to live without working, he should leavethe service of the convent and take his daughter with him; but that, asit was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the vows, shouldhave received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the ReverendPrioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as indemnity,for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of fivethousand francs.It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the PerpetualAdoration.On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise thekey to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter totouch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming whichproceeded from it.Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He alwayshad it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, thathe carried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it,and called this valise his inseparable, saying: "I am jealous of it."Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air withoutprofound anxiety.He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself fromsight there. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:--UltimeFauchelevent.At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order thathe might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in thesame quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at theslightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so thathe might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he hadso miraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were verypitiable, poor in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remotefrom each other, the one in the Rue de l'Ouest, the other in the Rue del'Homme Arme.He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, now to theRue de l'Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint.He had himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as agentleman from the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a littletemporary resting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domicilesin Paris for the sake of escaping from the police.CHAPTER II--JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARDHowever, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he hadarranged his existence there in the following fashion:--Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the bigsleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gildedfillets, the justice's drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vastarm-chairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed ofantique damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased inthe Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher's, put into Cosette'schamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these magnificentold things, he had amalgamated with this bric-a-brac all the gay andgraceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, an etagere,a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book,paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-giltdressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long damaskcurtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on thebed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, thecurtains were of tapestry. All winter long, Cosette's little house washeated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter'slodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with amattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, anearthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valisein one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he had aloaf of black bread on the table for his own use.When Toussaint came, he had said to her: "It is the young lady who isthe mistress of this house."--"And you, monsieur?" Toussaint replied inamazement.--"I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father."Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulatedtheir expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean puthis arm through Cosette's and took her for a walk. He led her to theLuxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took herto mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off.As it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and thepoor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon himThenardier's epistle: "To the benevolent gentleman of the church ofSaint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas." He was fond of taking Cosette to visit thepoor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet.Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself forwater to a fountain near by on the boulevard. Their wood and wine wereput into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay nearthe Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice asa grotto; for at the epoch of follies and "Little Houses" no love waswithout a grotto.In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined forthe reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants ofthe pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, theentire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a loveaffair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited tothe tax-collector's notices, and the summons of the guard. For M.Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard;he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of1831. The municipal information collected at that time had even reachedthe convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud,whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, consequently,worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall.Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mountedguard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise whichmixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean hadjust attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but hedid not appear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escapehis sergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessedno civil status, he was concealing his name, he was concealing hisidentity, so he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as wehave just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sumof his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. Thisman had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out withCosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air ofa retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally at night,he was always dressed in a workingman's trousers and blouse, and worea cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility? Both.Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, andhardly noticed her father's peculiarities. As for Toussaint, shevenerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said toher: "That's a queer fish." She replied: "He's a saint."Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emergedexcept by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through thegarden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived inthe Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left thegarden uncultivated, in order not to attract attention.In this, possibly, he made a mistake.CHAPTER III--FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUSThe garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had becomeextraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted togaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its freshand verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowedhis thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars ofthat ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to twogreen and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment ofundecipherable arabesque.There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues,several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting onthe wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grasseverywhere. Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned.Weeds abounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner ofland. The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothingin this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life;venerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had bent overtowards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch hadinclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of thatwhich expands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent overtowards that which trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres,clusters, tendrils, shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed,married, confounded themselves in each other; vegetation in a deepand close embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under thewell-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feetsquare, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity.This garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that isto say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city,quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet,solitary as a tomb, living as a throng.In Floreal[34] this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and withinits four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quiveredin the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths ofcosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling inits veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks,sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumblingsteps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street,flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy,perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, andit was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling aboutthere in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure,a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what thetwittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, a dreamyvapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, acalm and celestial sadness covered it; the intoxicating perfume of thehoneysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it, like anexquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers andthe wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt thesacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice theleaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, andallowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branchesand dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails werevisible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion,under any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, thistiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude,liberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old gatehad the air of saying: "This garden belongs to me."It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side,the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of pacesaway, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputiesnot far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the RueSaint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vaindid the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other'scourse at the neighboring cross-roads; the Rue Plumet was the desert;and the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passedover it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness,forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore tothis privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, greatcrimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles,uneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depthsof the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certainindescribable and savage grandeur; and for nature, which disconcertsthe petty arrangements of man, and which sheds herself always thoroughlywhere she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well as in the eagle,to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much rude forceand majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profoundand penetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolutesatisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the causeor to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomableecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity.Everything toils at everything.Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profitsthe rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of thehawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate thecourse of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is notdetermined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocalebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, thereverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanchesof creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, thelittle is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming visionfor the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and things;in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despisesthe other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear awayterrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it isdoing; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers.All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite.Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and withthe peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level thebirth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescopeends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the larger fieldof vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is anant-hill of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented,exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts ofsubstance. Elements and principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply witheach other, to such a point that the material and the moral world arebrought eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is perpetuallyreturning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal lifegoes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisiblemystery of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream,not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits aplanet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a force and ofthought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all,except that geometrical point, the I; bringing everything back to thesoul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, fromsummit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching theflight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, whoknows? Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of thecomet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the dropof water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor ofwhich is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.CHAPTER IV--CHANGE OF GATEIt seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wantonmysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chastemysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, ortunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurityfalling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. It isimpossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreatwholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. Thiscoquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had returned tovirginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman whothought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman whothought that he was a continuation of Lenotre, had turned it about, cut,ruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature had taken possession ofit once more, had filled it with shade, and had arranged it for love.There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Lovehad only to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure,grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, anda soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration,and of illusion.Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she wasa little more than fourteen, and she was at the "ungrateful age"; wehave already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homelyrather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward,thin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taughtreligion, and even and above all, devotion; then "history," that is tosay the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar,the participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing,etc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is agreat charm and a great peril. The soul of a young girl should not beleft in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too livelyare formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently anddiscreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities thanwith their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austerehalf-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There isnothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed ofthe memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman, which knowshow this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist.Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the worldare not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl'ssoul.Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the plural.As for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; buthe was only an old man and he knew nothing at all.Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing awoman for life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorancewhich is called innocence!Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The conventturns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thusthrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, since it cannotoverflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions,suppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire foradventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the innerobscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passionsimmediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them toenter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over thehuman heart, should last during the whole life.On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet andmore dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuationof solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, buta nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreamsas in the convent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but onethat opened on the street.Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. JeanValjean gave this neglected garden over to her. "Do what you like withit," he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumpsand all the stones, she hunted for "beasts"; she played in it, whileawaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this gardenfor the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, whileawaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would seethrough the boughs above her head.And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, withall her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodmana beloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M.Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjeanhad continued this practice; he had come to converse well; he possessedthe secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which hasspontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness toseason his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was soft. Duringtheir conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations ofeverything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he hadsuffered. As she listened to him, Cosette's eyes wandered vaguely about.This simple man sufficed for Cosette's thought, the same as the wildgarden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after thebutterflies, she came panting up to him and said: "Ah! How I have run!"He kissed her brow.Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where JeanValjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in thepavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved backcourtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his littlelodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-roomhung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjeansometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned: "Dogo to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!"She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so gracefulwhen they come from a daughter to her father."Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don't you have a carpet hereand a stove?""Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who havenot even a roof over their heads.""Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?""Because you are a woman and a child.""Bah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?""Certain men.""That is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged tohave a fire."And again she said to him:--"Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?""Because, my daughter.""Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too."Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean atewhite bread.Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayedmorning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. TheThenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. Sheremembered that she had gone "one day, at night," to fetch water in aforest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed toher that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjeanwho had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effectof a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders,and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep,as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean's daughter,and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother hadpassed into that good man and had come to dwell near her.When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, anddropped a silent tear, saying to herself: "Perhaps this man is mymother."Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profoundignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,--maternity being alsoabsolutely unintelligible to virginity,--had ended by fancying that shehad had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her mother'sname. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained silent. Ifshe repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once she insisted;the smile ended in a tear.This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliverthis name to the hazards of another memory than his own?So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talkto her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossiblefor him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was itbecause of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certainreligious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette's thought; and ofplacing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him,the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of Fantine,and felt himself overwhelmed with silence.Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appearedto have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had beenin Fantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime,returned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation overthe peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in hergrave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? Wewho believe in death, are not among the number who will reject thismysterious explanation.Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name ofFantine.One day Cosette said to him:--"Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings.My mother must have been almost a saint during her life.""Through martyrdom," replied Jean Valjean.However, Jean Valjean was happy.When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy,in the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt withinhim with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, sowholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundatedwith angelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically that this wouldlast all their lives; he told himself that he really had not sufferedsufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in thedepths of his soul, for having permitted him to be loved thus, he, awretch, by that innocent being.CHAPTER V--THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAROne day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she saidto herself: "Really!" It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. Thisthrew her in a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment shehad never thought of her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but shedid not look at herself. And then, she had so often been told that shewas homely; Jean Valjean alone said gently: "No indeed! no indeed!" Atall events, Cosette had always thought herself homely, and had grown upin that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, allat once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: "Noindeed!" That night, she did not sleep. "What if I were pretty!" shethought. "How odd it would be if I were pretty!" And she recalled thoseof her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent,and she said to herself: "What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?"The next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this time,and she was assailed with doubts: "Where did I get such an idea?" saidshe; "no, I am ugly." She had not slept well, that was all, her eyeswere sunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on thepreceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made hervery sad not to be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look atherself again, and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hairwith her back turned to the mirror.In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool ordid some convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean readbeside her. Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was renderedquite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemedto her that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: "A prettywoman! but badly dressed." "Bah!" she thought, "he does not mean me.I am well dressed and ugly." She was then wearing a plush hat and hermerino gown.At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor oldToussaint saying: "Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?"Cosette did not hear her father's reply, but Toussaint's words causeda sort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up toher room, flew to the looking-glass,--it was three months since shehad looked at herself,--and gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzledherself.She was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with Toussaintand her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, herhair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blueeyes. The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, likethe sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussainthad said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken,there could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the gardenagain, thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birdssinging, though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun amongthe trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressibledelight.Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppressionat heart.In fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror thatbeauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette's sweetface. The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she becameaware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected lightwhich was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl'sperson, wounded Jean Valjean's sombre eye. He felt that it was a changein a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fearof disarranging something. This man, who had passed through all mannerof distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, whohad been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint, who, afterhaving dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisiblebut heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had notreleased from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment andbrought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight ofpublic opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, andmerely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature,of the world, one thing, that Cosette might love him!That Cosette might continue to love him! That God would not preventthe heart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him!Beloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased, loadedwith benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it was wellwith him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: "Do you wantanything better?" he would have answered: "No." God might have said tohim: "Do you desire heaven?" and he would have replied: "I should loseby it."Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface,made him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had neverknown very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but heunderstood instinctively, that it was something terrible.He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever moretriumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocentand formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, ofhis old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.He said to himself: "How beautiful she is! What is to become of me?"There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and thetenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would havegazed upon with joy.The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself:"Decidedly I am beautiful!" Cosette began to pay attention to hertoilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: "Pretty, but badlydressed," the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and hadvanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which aredestined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love isthe other.With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her.She conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Herfather had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the wholescience of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, thestuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that sciencewhich makes of the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and sodangerous. The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne.In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue deBabylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the "bestdressed" women in Paris, which means a great deal more.She would have liked to encounter her "passer-by," to see what he wouldsay, and to "teach him a lesson!" The truth is, that she was ravishingin every respect, and that she distinguished the difference between abonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt thathe could never do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wingssprouting on Cosette.Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette's toilet, a womanwould have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain littleproprieties, certain special conventionalities, were not observed byCosette. A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girldoes not dress in damask.The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle,and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean's arm, gay, radiant,rosy, proud, dazzling. "Father," she said, "how do you like me in thisguise?" Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voiceof an envious man: "Charming!" He was the same as usual during theirwalk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:--"Won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again,--you know the ones Imean?"This took place in Cosette's chamber. Cosette turned towards thewardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl's clothes were hanging."That disguise!" said she. "Father, what do you want me to do with it?Oh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With thatmachine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog."Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had alwaysheretofore asked to remain at home, saying: "Father, I enjoy myself morehere with you," now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is theuse of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does notdisplay them?He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the backgarden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenadeback and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy,never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the graceof ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousnessis ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocentcreature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradisewithout being conscious of it. But what she had lost in ingenuous grace,she gained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole person, permeatedwith the joy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth asplendid melancholy.It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw heronce more at the Luxembourg.CHAPTER VI--THE BATTLE BEGUNCosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire.Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew togetherthese two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormyelectricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love astwo clouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to overflowand mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finallyfallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that twobeings fell in love because they looked at each other. That is the waypeople do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest isnothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than thesegreat shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange ofthat spark.At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glancewhich troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that he had also launcheda look which disturbed Cosette.He caused her the same good and the same evil.She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she hadscrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere.Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun tothink Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young manwas nothing to her.Still, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he hadbeautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone of voicewhen she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he held himselfbadly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was all hisown, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole personwas noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he seemedto be poor, yet his air was fine.On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other thosefirst, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette didnot immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house inthe Rue de l'Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, hadcome to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought ofthat strange young man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed topay attention to her, and it did not appear to her that this attentionwas the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary,somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual. Asubstratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea causedher a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take her revenge atlast.Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, thoughin an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play withtheir beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.The reader will recall Marius' hesitations, his palpitations, histerrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexedCosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: "Father, let us stroll abouta little in that direction." Seeing that Marius did not come to her,she went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then,strange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man istimidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, and yetnothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach eachother and assuming, each the other's qualities.That day, Cosette's glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius'glance set Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and Cosetteuneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profoundmelancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since theday before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in younggirls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. Itmelts in love, which is its sun.Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word utteredin its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which enteredthe convent, amour (love) was replaced by tambour (drum) or pandour.This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls,such as: Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, Pity is not a pandour. ButCosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself muchwith the "drum." Therefore, she did not know what name to give to whatshe now felt. Is any one the less ill because one does not know the nameof one's malady?She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. Shedid not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful ordangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved. Shewould have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her: "You do notsleep? But that is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! Youhave oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! Youblush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at theend of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!" She would not haveunderstood, and she would have replied: "What fault is there of mine ina matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing?"It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited tothe state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mutecontemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition ofyouth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaininga dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, buthaving as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nordefect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, achimaera with a form. Any nearer and more palpable meeting would havealarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was still half immersed inthe exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the fears of childrenand all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, withwhich she had been permeated for the space of five years, was still inthe process of slow evaporation from her person, and made everythingtremble around her. In this situation he was not a lover, he was noteven an admirer, he was a vision. She set herself to adoring Marius assomething charming, luminous, and impossible.As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him withall frankness.Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk withimpatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thoughtwhen she said to Jean Valjean:--"What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!"Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did notaddress each other, they did not salute each other, they did not knoweach other; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which areseparated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed,beautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and inignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.CHAPTER VII--TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALFAll situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Naturewarned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjeanshuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knewnothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the darknessin which he walked, as though he felt on one side of him something inprocess of construction, and on the other, something which was crumblingaway. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the deep law of God,by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of sight of"the father." Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimesespied him. Marius' manners were no longer in the least natural. Heexhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quiteclose to them as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretendedto be reading; why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his oldcoat, now he wore his new one every day; Jean Valjean was not surethat he did not have his hair curled, his eyes were very queer, he woregloves; in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man.Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was thematter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, andthat it must be concealed.There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which hadrecently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed bythat stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might beaccidental, no doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident.He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day,however, he could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vaguedespair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, hesaid to her: "What a very pedantic air that young man has!"Cosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would havereplied: "Why, no, he is charming." Ten years later, with the loveof Marius in her heart, she would have answered: "A pedant, andinsufferable to the sight! You are right!"--At the moment in lifeand the heart which she had then attained, she contented herself withreplying, with supreme calmness: "That young man!"As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life."How stupid I am!" thought Jean Valjean. "She had not noticed him. It isI who have pointed him out to her."Oh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, ofthose vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles,that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trapwhatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjeanhad instituted an undeclared war against Marius, which Marius, withthe sublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. JeanValjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he changedhis bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg;Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all theinterrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, heingenuously answered "yes." But Cosette remained immured in her apparentunconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjeanarrived at the following conclusion: "That ninny is madly in love withCosette, but Cosette does not even know that he exists."None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minutewhen Cosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everythingbegin with indifference?Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from hisseat to depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: "What,already?"Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as hedid not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things,he feared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweetto the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicatedMarius, who perceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in allthe world but an adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing onMarius flashing and terrible eyes. He, who had finally come to believehimself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced moments whenMarius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage andferocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, whichhad formerly contained so much wrath, opening once more and rising upagainst that young man. It almost seemed to him that unknown craterswere forming in his bosom.What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He camecreeping about, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: "Hey!Why not?" He came to prowl about his, Jean Valjean's, life! to prowlabout his happiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away!Jean Valjean added: "Yes, that's it! What is he in search of? Anadventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I? What!I have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy,and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have sufferedeverything that man can suffer, I have grown old without having beenyoung, I have lived without a family, without relatives, withoutfriends, without life, without children, I have left my blood on everystone, on every bramble, on every mile-post, along every wall, I havebeen gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind, althoughothers have been malicious, I have become an honest man once more, inspite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have done andhave forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the momentwhen I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, at themoment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I have whatI desire, it is well, it is good, I have paid, I have earned it, allthis is to take flight, all this will vanish, and I shall lose Cosette,and I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, because it has pleased agreat booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg."Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam.It was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemysurveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One dayhe followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest. Another day he spoke tothe porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:"Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?" On themorrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at lastperceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He sworeto himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourgor in the Rue de l'Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, shedid not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the pointwhere she was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. JeanValjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries whichare charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; theconsequence was that he did not understand the grave significance ofCosette's silence.He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On hisside and on hers, inexperience had joined issue.Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette:--"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?"A ray illuminated Cosette's pale face."Yes," said she.They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer wentthere. Marius was not there.On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:--"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?"She replied, sadly and gently:--"No."Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at thisgentleness.What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already soimpenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking placein Cosette's soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjeanremained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passedwhole nights asking himself: "What has Cosette in her mind?" and inthinking of the things that she might be thinking about.Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards thatcloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessibleglacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, thatconvent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, whereall perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored thatEden forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madlyemerged! How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having broughtCosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurledto the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, "Whathave I done?"However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper,no harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean'smanners were more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything couldhave betrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Mariusas she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly beingconscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customarystrolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of herheart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, andthat if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her fatherwould take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. JeanValjean had tacitly accepted Cosette's tacit consent. She regretted it.It was too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day onwhich she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. Whatwas to be done? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish ather heart, which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she nolonger knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining orshining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season fordahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming thanthe Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought homewas starched too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done "hermarketing" well or ill; and she remained dejected, absorbed, attentiveto but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes bynight at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this,except her pallor.She still wore her sweet face for him.This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean.Sometimes he asked her:--"What is the matter with you?"She replied: "There is nothing the matter with me."And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she wouldadd:--"And you, father--is there anything wrong with you?""With me? Nothing," said he.These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with sotouching an affection, and who had lived so long for each othernow suffered side by side, each on the other's account; withoutacknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each other, andwith a smile.CHAPTER VIII--THE CHAIN-GANGJean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in itssorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance.At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It isthe property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. Hehad an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. Hewould have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm bysome external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we havejust said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their verychildishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace onthe imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general onhorseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, thecommandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness itwould be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was anincontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would bedazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of theTuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would sufficefor Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwellin the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes tooka pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment whichbefits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalentto a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streetsare deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, likedto rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned on the precedingevening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, theyset out before daybreak, and these trips were so many small delights forCosette. These innocent eccentricities please young people.Jean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the leastfrequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There thenexisted, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poormeadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew insummer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had beengathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, butpeeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not boredthere. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became alittle girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off herhat, laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, and gathered bunches of flowers.She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them;gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl whocherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy onthe wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placedon her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowinguntil they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of earlystrolls.One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection ofthe autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break ofday near the Barriere du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; adelightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in thedeep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiveramid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. Alark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigiousheight, and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmedimmensity. In the East, the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on theclear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliantwas rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escapefrom a gloomy edifice.All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few straylaborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way totheir work along the side-paths.Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at thegate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his backtowards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point ofrising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which themind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which areequivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be calledvertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to returnto earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He wasthinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing camebetween him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, alight which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy inhis revery. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at theclouds as they turned rosy.All at once Cosette exclaimed: "Father, I should think some one wascoming yonder." Jean Valjean raised his eyes.Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere duMaine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sevres,and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of thecauseway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard anoise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort ofconfused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was comingfrom the boulevard was turning into the road.It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it wasbristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load couldnot be distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whipswere cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathedin shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from theboulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towardsthe barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made theirappearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear ofthe wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes werevisible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, aclanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and asthis something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turnedinto a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the treeswith the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day,which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap whichwas at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turnedinto the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:--Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six weresingularly constructed. They resembled coopers' drays; they consistedof long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rearextremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attachedto four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters ofmen were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divinedrather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back toback, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,--this wasthe manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backsthey had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on theirnecks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each man hadhis collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twentymen had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized witha sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the groundwith the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds.In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with musketsstood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot. The ironnecklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggagewagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and carried asonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains,among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched atfull length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work,was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served forformer punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. Oneach side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearingthree-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby,covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and thetrousers of undertakers' men, half gray, half blue, which were almosthanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short sabres,muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards.These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and theauthority of the executioner. The one who appeared to be their chiefheld a postilion's whip in his hand. All these details, blurred by thedimness of dawn, became more and more clearly outlined as the lightincreased. At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mountedgendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached thebarrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, asis frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides ofthe road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of peoplecalling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hasteningup to gaze were audible.The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along insilence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linentrousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The restof their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements werehorribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin inrags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps,and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow;many wore women's headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairybreasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooeddesigns could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids;eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or threehad a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspendedunder them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them heldin his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearanceof a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread whichhe was eating. There were no eyes there which were not either dry,dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the menin chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound ofa blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades orskulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible;their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashedtogether, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, theirfists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in therear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. Itwas evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain mightdescend, that it might be followed by another and another, and thattheir dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, thesemen would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not againget warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by thedownpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes fromthe whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering, that thechain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs wouldcontinue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sightof these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds ofautumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furiesof the air, like trees and stones.Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men,who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon,and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled withmisery.Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orientburst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all thoseferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins,oaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severedthe file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet andwheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces;it was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed,fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained ingloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which theyblew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuatedthese lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; therewas not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason ofwretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would havesaid that the sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of thelightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song,and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality,a potpourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the treesshivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeoislistened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned byspectres.All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were tobe found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths,bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savagegrins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like thoseof young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages,and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which deathalone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave,in all probability, and who could make a comparison of his chains. Thefrightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; atthat degree of abasement, the last transformations were suffered by allin their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, wasthe equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no choicepossible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of themud. It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of thatunclean procession had not classified them. These beings had beenfettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical disorder, probably, andloaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, when groupedtogether, always end by evolving a result; all additions of wretched mengive a sum total, each chain exhaled a common soul, and each dray-loadhad its own physiognomy. By the side of the one where they were singing,there was one where they were howling; a third where they were begging;one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; another loadmenaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as silentas the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circlesof hell on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures,performed in sinister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariotof the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbetcart.One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made apretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth.An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five yearsold, and said to him: "Rascal, let that be a warning to you!"As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be thecaptain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearfuldull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon theseven dray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubledthe delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flieson these wounds.Jean Valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were nolonger eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace theglance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconsciousof reality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and ofcatastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a vision.He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not move hisfeet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold youfast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself,athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchralpersecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium which waspursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesturehabitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that thiswas, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make thisdetour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on theroad to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years before, he hadhimself passed through that barrier.Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did notunderstand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; atlength she cried:--"Father! What are those men in those carts?"Jean Valjean replied: "Convicts.""Whither are they going?""To the galleys."At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, becamezealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was aperfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a hideousobedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace, dartingglances like chained wolves.Cosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:--"Father, are they still men?""Sometimes," answered the unhappy man.It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak fromBicetre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau,where the King then was. This caused the horrible journey to last threeor four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the objectof sparing the royal personage a sight of it.Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters areshocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thoroughshaking up.Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back tothe Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with otherquestions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he wastoo much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply tothem. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake herselfto bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking toherself: "It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in mypathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close athand."Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day,there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,--fetes inParis, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatricalperformances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at the Arc de l'Etoile,illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, andtook Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting herfrom the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smilingtumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her.The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence ofuniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of anational guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betakinghimself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object.Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,moreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversionwith the light and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout toodisdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete; so thatJean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that notrace of that hideous vision remained.Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, andthey were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction ofthe rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, andto the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had causedCosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in thatnegligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in anadorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star;and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submittingto the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisyto pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, I love a little,passionately, etc.--who was there who could have taught her? She washandling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion thatto pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were afourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the airof that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of thosetiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radianceemitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on oneside. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one wouldhave said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went onattentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to bethinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be somethingcharming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with thedelicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: "Father, what arethe galleys like?"BOOK FOURTH.--SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON HIGHCHAPTER I--A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHINThus their life clouded over by degrees.But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained tothem, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothingto those who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on thesevisits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of theirformer free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a goodone, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed manylittle children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at thisepoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den.On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in thepavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound onhis left arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled aburn, and which he explained in some way or other. This wound resultedin his being detained in the house for a month with fever. He would notcall in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, "Call the dog-doctor," saidhe.Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air andsuch angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean feltall his former joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, andhe gazed at Cosette, saying: "Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a goodmisfortune!"Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilionand again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard.She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to himthe books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. JeanValjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in theseineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette'scoldness,--all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He hadreached the point where he said to himself: "I imagined all that. I aman old fool."His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of theThenardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had,after a fashion, glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in makinghis escape; all trace of him was lost--what more did he care for! heonly thought of those wretched beings to pity them. "Here they are inprison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,"he thought, "but what a lamentable family in distress!"As for the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette had notreferred to it again.Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; Cosettehad the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the evening,in the wounded man's humble abode, she warbled melancholy songs whichdelighted Jean Valjean.Spring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year,that Jean Valjean said to Cosette:--"You never go there; I want you to stroll in it.""As you like, father," said Cosette.And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in thegarden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, whowas probably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever wentthere.Jean Valjean's wound had created a diversion.When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he wasconvalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced acontentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturallyhad it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growinglonger, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it aportion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, freshas dawn always is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to weepat times like the new-born being that it is. In that month, naturehas charming gleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from themeadows and the flowers into the heart of man.Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of thatApril joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. Insensibly, andwithout her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit.In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at midday.Cosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she did notaccount for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o'clock, afterbreakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the gardenfor a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in thesunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she didnot perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy.Jean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more."Oh! What a good wound!" he repeated in a whisper.And he felt grateful to the Thenardiers.His wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in thatfashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with someadventure.CHAPTER II--MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING APHENOMENONOne evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he rememberedthat he had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becomingtiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. Hestrolled out beyond the Salpetriere into deserted regions; that iswhere windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one alwaysfinds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be thevillage of Austerlitz.In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old gardenhaunted by an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passableapple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which wasnot securely fastened, and where one might contrive to get an apple. Oneapple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was Adam's ruin mightprove Gavroche's salvation. The garden abutted on a solitary, unpavedlane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; thegarden was separated from it by a hedge.Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, herecognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined thehedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there wasnot even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche beganthe operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one wastalking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in thehedge.[Illustration: Succor from Below 4b4-1-succor-from-below]A couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side,exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would havebeen made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, andon this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old womanwas standing in front of him. The old woman was grumbling. Gavroche, whowas not very discreet, listened."Monsieur Mabeuf!" said the old woman."Mabeuf!" thought Gavroche, "that name is a perfect farce."The old man who was thus addressed, did not stir. The old womanrepeated:--"Monsieur Mabeuf!"The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mindto answer:--"What is it, Mother Plutarque?""Mother Plutarque!" thought Gavroche, "another farcical name."Mother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept theconversation:--"The landlord is not pleased.""Why?""We owe three quarters rent.""In three months, we shall owe him for four quarters.""He says that he will turn you out to sleep.""I will go.""The green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave herfagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have nowood.""There is the sun.""The butcher refuses to give credit; he will not let us have any moremeat.""That is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy.""What shall we have for dinner?""Bread.""The baker demands a settlement, and says, 'no money, no bread.'""That is well.""What will you eat?""We have apples in the apple-room.""But, Monsieur, we can't live like that without money.""I have none."The old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell intothought. Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark.The first result of Gavroche's meditation was, that instead of scalingthe hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a littleat the foot of the thicket."Come," exclaimed Gavroche mentally, "here's a nook!" and he curled upin it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf's bench. Hecould hear the octogenarian breathe.Then, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep.It was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept onthe watch.The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed alivid line between two rows of dark bushes.All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance.One was in front, the other some distance in the rear."There come two creatures," muttered Gavroche.The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent andthoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was walking slowlybecause of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.The second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by thatof the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, supplenessand agility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce anddisquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then calledan elegant; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut,probably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head washeld erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the paleprofile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The profilehad a rose in its mouth. This second form was well known to Gavroche; itwas Montparnasse.He could have told nothing about the other, except that he was arespectable old man.Gavroche immediately began to take observations.One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected withthe other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. Thebedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment.Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokenedsomething threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin's heart moved withcompassion for the old man.What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of another!It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse. Gavroche did notshut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and thechild in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtableruffian eighteen years of age.While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly andhideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of thespider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, boundedupon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him,and Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one ofthese men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a kneeof marble upon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche hadexpected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one whowas on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant fromGavroche.The old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in sucha terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailedhad exchanged roles."Here's a hearty veteran!" thought Gavroche.He could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applausewasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as theywere, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged inthis aside: "Can he be dead!"The goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose tohis feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:--"Get up."Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse'sattitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who hasbeen caught by a sheep.Gavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyeswith his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of aspectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowedfrom the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodmanquestioned, Montparnasse replied."How old are you?""Nineteen.""You are strong and healthy. Why do you not work?""It bores me.""What is your trade?""An idler.""Speak seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like tobe?""A thief."A pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. Hestood motionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in thetwitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried acrook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts toescape.The old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with onehand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.The old man's revery lasted for some time, then, looking steadily atMontparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of thedarkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did notlose a single syllable:--"My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the mostlaborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare totoil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It isthe rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is craftyand ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will bedrawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time,and save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short timeyou will be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more.Toil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand ofimplacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your living, tohave a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men? Well!You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will findennui his torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be aslave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on theother. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro slave.Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you shall havethe sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle in yourthroat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work; it willseem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester, thesailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the blessedspirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To guide theplough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in the wind,what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll, march! Drag yourhalter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothingis your object. Well, not a week, not a day, not an hour shall you havefree from oppression. You will be able to lift nothing without anguish.Every minute that passes will make your muscles crack. What is a featherto others will be a rock to you. The simplest things will become steepacclivities. Life will become monstrous all about you. To go, to come,to breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. Your lungs willproduce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether youshall walk here rather than there, will become a problem that must besolved. Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push, andthere he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will be obligedto pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step into thestreet do? He goes down stairs; you will tear up your sheets, littleby little you will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of yourwindow, and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, andit will be night, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the ropeis too short, but one way of descending will remain to you, to fall. Todrop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On whatis beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at therisk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk ofdrowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask,of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times aday, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. Alock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by alocksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute aterrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it intwo plates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is yourbusiness. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, takinggreat care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, sothat they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover.The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. Tothe overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What willyou put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which youwill have cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as longas a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock, youwill sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your window,and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this prodigyaccomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patienceexecuted, what will be your recompense if it becomes known that youare the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What precipices areidleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is a melancholyresolution? To live in idleness on the property of society! to beuseless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depthof wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He willbecome vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You have butone thought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drinkwater, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on a plank with a fetterwhose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted toyour limbs. You will break those fetters, you will flee. That is well.You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, and you will eatgrass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. Andthen you will pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, groping foryour jug that you may drink, gnawing at a horrible loaf of darknesswhich dogs would not touch, eating beans that the worms have eatenbefore you. You will be a wood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have pity onyourself, you miserable young child, who were sucking at nurse lessthan twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a mother still alive! Iconjure you, listen to me, I entreat you. You desire fine black cloth,varnished shoes, to have your hair curled and sweet-smelling oils onyour locks, to please low women, to be handsome. You will be shavenclean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes. You want ringson your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on your neck. If youglance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you will enter there atthe age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty! You will enter young,rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and all your white teeth, and yourhandsome, youthful hair; you will come out broken, bent, wrinkled,toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my poor child, you are on thewrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; the hardest of all workis thieving. Believe me, do not undertake that painful profession ofan idle man. It is not comfortable to become a rascal. It is lessdisagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder on what I have saidto you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is."And the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter'shand; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it toslide gently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanicalprecaution as though he had stolen it.All this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back andtranquilly resumed his stroll."The blockhead!" muttered Montparnasse.Who was this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined.Montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk.This contemplation was fatal to him.While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeufwas still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gaminemerged from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in thedark, as the latter stood there motionless. In this manner he came upto Montparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated his handinto the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized thepurse, withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to his crawling,he slipped away like an adder through the shadows. Montparnasse, whohad no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged in thought for thefirst time in his life, perceived nothing. When Gavroche had once moreattained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over thehedge, and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.The purse fell on Father Mabeuf's foot. This commotion roused him.He bent over and picked up the purse.He did not understand in the least, and opened it.The purse had two compartments; in one of them there was some smallchange; in the other lay six napoleons.M. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his housekeeper."That has fallen from heaven," said Mother Plutarque.BOOK FIFTH.--THE END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE BEGINNINGCHAPTER I--SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINEDCosette's grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or fivemonths previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, enteredupon its convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her father,the gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something almost resemblingforgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop, into that soul, whichwas so virgin and so young. Was the fire wholly extinct there? Or wasit merely that layers of ashes had formed? The truth is, that she hardlyfelt the painful and burning spot any longer.One day she suddenly thought of Marius: "Why!" said she, "I no longerthink of him."That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, witha wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, asword under his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing thegate. Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face,was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius. Hehad a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this officer doubtlessbelonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.On the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the hour.From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.The officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that "badly kept"garden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature,who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,--who is notunknown to the reader, and whose name was Theodule Gillenormand,--passedby."See here!" they said to him, "there's a little creature there who ismaking eyes at you, look.""Have I the time," replied the lancer, "to look at all the girls wholook at me?"This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavilytowards agony, and was saying: "If I could but see her before Idie!"--Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that momentgazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, andhe would have expired with grief.Whose fault was it? No one's.Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves insorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge intosorrow and emerge from it again.Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatalphase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which the isolatedheart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling,as chance directs, to the capital of a marble column or to the post ofa wine-shop: A rapid and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, beshe rich or poor, for wealth does not prevent a bad choice; misalliancesare made in very high circles, real misalliance is that of souls; and asmany an unknown young man, without name, without birth, without fortune,is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grandideas, so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, whohas polished boots and varnished words, if looked at not outside, butinside, a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing more than ablock obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions; thepost of a drinking-shop.What did Cosette's soul contain? Passion calmed or lulled to sleep;something limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth, and gloomylower down. The image of the handsome officer was reflected inthe surface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths?--Quite at thebottom?--Possibly. Cosette did not know.A singular incident supervened.CHAPTER II--COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONSDuring the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This,as the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals.He remained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? Noone knew, not even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of one of thesedepartures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as alittle blind-alley at the corner of which she read: Impasse de laPlanchette. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back to theRue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking in the house thatJean Valjean took these little trips.So Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: "I shall return in three days."That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to getrid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to sing,accompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe: "Huntersastray in the wood!" which is probably the most beautiful thing in allthe sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped inthought.All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps inthe garden.It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint,she was in bed, and it was ten o'clock at night.She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, andlaid her ear against it.It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walkingvery softly.She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened asmall wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was atthe full. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day.There was no one there.She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that wasvisible was that the street was deserted as usual.Cosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she hadheard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy andmagnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrifieddepths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in whichone hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of thehuntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight.She thought no more about it.Moreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in herveins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runsbarefoot. It will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove.There was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her.On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she wasstrolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts whichoccupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similarto that of the preceding evening, as though some one were walkingbeneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but she toldherself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as thefriction of two branches which have moved from side to side, and shepaid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing.She emerged from "the thicket"; she had still to cross a small lawn toregain the steps.The moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette's shadow infront of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.Cosette halted in alarm.Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf anothershadow, which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow whichhad a round hat.It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border ofthe clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, orstir, or turn her head.Then she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.There was no one there.She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far asthe gate, and found nothing.She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this anotherhallucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination mightpass, but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, thatthe shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear roundhats.On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what shethought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to seeher father shrug his shoulders and say to her: "You are a little goose."Jean Valjean grew anxious."It cannot be anything," said he.He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she sawhim examining the gate with great attention.During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctlyheard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window.She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, therewas a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. Just as shewas about to scream, the moon lighted up the man's profile. It was herfather. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: "He is very uneasy!"Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in thegarden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to riselater; at one o'clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burstof laughter and her father's voice calling her:--"Cosette!"She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened herwindow.Her father was standing on the grass-plot below."I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you," said he; "look,there is your shadow with the round hat."And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, andwhich did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a manwearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe ofsheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions wereallayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of ironchimney-pots.Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she didnot pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot wasreally in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought shehad seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky.She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-potwhich is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when someone looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosettehad turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this.Cosette's serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her tobe complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there couldpossibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or atnight.A few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.CHAPTER III--ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINTIn the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms,but which could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from theoutside, past the trees and the gate.One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out;Cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze wasblowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectlesssadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invinciblesadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows,from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow.Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on thegrass drenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species ofmelancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: "Really, one needswooden shoes for the garden at this hour. One takes cold."She returned to the bench.As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spotwhich she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently, notbeen there a moment before.Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at oncethe idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all byitself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrustthrough the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, thefear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible; she didnot touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in thehouse, and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the door-likewindow opening on the flight of steps. She inquired of Toussaint:--"Has my father returned yet?""Not yet, Mademoiselle."[We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered.May we be permitted to dispense with it for the future. The musicalnotation of an infirmity is repugnant to us.]Jean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal strolls, oftenreturned quite late at night."Toussaint," went on Cosette, "are you careful to thoroughly barricadethe shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening,and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them?""Oh! be easy on that score, Miss."Toussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware of thefact, but she could not refrain from adding:--"It is so solitary here.""So far as that is concerned," said Toussaint, "it is true. We might beassassinated before we had time to say ouf! And Monsieur does not sleepin the house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters uplike prisons. Lone women! That is enough to make one shudder, I believeyou! Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter your chamber atnight and say: 'Hold your tongue!' and begin to cut your throat. It'snot the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and that's all right;it's the abomination of feeling those people touch you. And then, theirknives; they can't be able to cut well with them! Ah, good gracious!""Be quiet," said Cosette. "Fasten everything thoroughly."Cosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, andpossibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week,which recurred to her memory, dared not even say to her: "Go and look atthe stone which has been placed on the bench!" for fear of opening thegarden gate and allowing "the men" to enter. She saw that all the doorsand windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go all over thehouse from garret to cellar, locked herself up in her own chamber,bolted her door, looked under her couch, went to bed and slept badly.All night long she saw that big stone, as large as a mountain and fullof caverns.At sunrise,--the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at allour terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in direct proportionto our terror which they have caused,--at sunrise Cosette, when shewoke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself: "What haveI been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard aweek or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of thechimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?" The sun, which was glowing throughthe crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains crimson,reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from herthoughts, even the stone."There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a roundhat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest."She dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, andbroke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was there.But this lasted only for a moment. That which is terror by night iscuriosity by day."Bah!" said she, "come, let us see what it is."She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it wassomething which resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. Cosetteseized it. There was no address on one side, no seal on the other.Yet the envelope, though unsealed, was not empty. Papers could be seeninside.Cosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it was no longer curiosity;it was a beginning of anxiety.Cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper,each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine andrather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.Cosette looked for a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed?To her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench.From whom did it come? An irresistible fascination took possessionof her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which weretrembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acaciasall bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof,and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said toherself that she must know what it contained.This is what she read.CHAPTER IV--A HEART BENEATH A STONE[Illustration: Cosette with Letter  4b4-5-cosette-after-letter]The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of asingle being even to God, that is love.Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills theworld! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One couldcomprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father ofall evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtainis sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.God is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things areblack, creatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that beingtransparent.Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever theattitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, whichpossess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeingeach other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitudeof mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of thebirds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light ofthe sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation.And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love issufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages.Oh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her.The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love, thatis the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite,the inexhaustible is requisite.Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Likeit, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible,imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us, which isimmortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which nothing canextinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones, andwe see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.Oh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand eachother, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glanceswhich penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss!strolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I havesometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves fromthe lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies ofmen.God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to givethem endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, infact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffablefelicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, isimpossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is theplenitude of man.You look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and becauseit is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greatermystery, woman.All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lackair and we stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible.Suffocation of the soul.When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelicunity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they areconcerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries ofthe same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of thesame spirit. Love, soar.On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as shewalks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: tothink of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.What love commences can be finished by God alone.True love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or ahandkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and itshopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitelylittle.If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitiveplant; if you are a man, be love.Nothing suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; wepossess paradise, we desire heaven.Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understandhow to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and morethan heaven, it has voluptuousness."Does she still come to the Luxembourg?" "No, sir." "This is the churchwhere she attends mass, is it not?" "She no longer comes here." "Doesshe still live in this house?" "She has moved away." "Where has she goneto dwell?""She did not say."What a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul!Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shameon the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a childof him!There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. Thereis a being who carried off my sky when she went away.Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, handin hand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing afinger,--that would suffice for my eternity!Ye who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to livein it.Love. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture.There is ecstasy in agony.Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a longtrial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. Thisdestiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside thetomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish thedefinitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceivethe infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead.In the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! tohim who shall have loved only bodies, forms, appearances! Death willdeprive him of all. Try to love souls, you will find them again.I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. Hishat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; water trickledthrough his shoes, and the stars through his soul.What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it isto love! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longercomposed of anything but what is pure; it no longer rests on anythingthat is not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no moregerminate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul,inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the cloudsand the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, itsvanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feelsanything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crestsof mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.If there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.CHAPTER V--COSETTE AFTER THE LETTERAs Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very momentwhen she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, thehandsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,--it was hishour; Cosette thought him hideous.She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the mostcharming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but withdivers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has beenadded to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was,then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly,without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosettehad never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she alreadyperceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of ahalf-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone beforeher eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance. The educationwhich she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and neverof love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of theflame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealedto her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning,the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon hera handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a passionate,ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow, andan immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. Whatwas this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address,without date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigmacomposed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel andread by a virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, thelove-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil anddejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to theabsent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. Thishad been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven.These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what mightbe called drops of soul.Now, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?Cosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only.He!Day had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. She felt anunheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written!he was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing!While she was forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had sheforgotten him? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for asingle moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire hadbeen smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainlynow; it had but made headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, andhad inflamed her whole being. This note-book was like a spark whichhad fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the conflagrationstarting up once more.She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: "Ohyes!" said she, "how perfectly I recognize all that! That is what I hadalready read in his eyes." As she was finishing it for the third time,Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spursupon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought himinsipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, andextremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.She turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly havethrown something at his head.She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber toperuse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream.When she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in herbosom.All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. Theabyss of Eden had yawned once more.All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. She scarcelythought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain,she could not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped through a tremor,what? vague things. She dared make herself no promises, and she didnot wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over hercountenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her, atintervals, that she was entering the land of chimaeras; she said toherself: "Is this reality?" Then she felt of the dear paper within herbosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she felt its anglesagainst her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, hewould have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy,which overflowed from beneath her eyelids.--"Oh yes!" she thought, "itis certainly he! This comes from him, and is for me!"And she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestialchance, had given him back to her.Oh transfiguration of love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, thatintervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief toanother thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard to the Lion's Ditch, overthe roofs of La Force.CHAPTER VI--OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELYWhen evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. Shearranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dresswhose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which,through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, andwas, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent." It was not in the leastindecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet thuswithout knowing why she did so.Did she mean to go out? No.Was she expecting a visitor? No.At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen,which opened on the back yard.She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branchesfrom time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung verylow.In this manner she reached the bench.The stone was still there.She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though shewished to caress and thank it.All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which oneundergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she doesnot see the person.She turned her head and rose to her feet.It was he.His head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His blackclothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light onhis fine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil ofincomparable sweetness, he had something about him that suggested deathand night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, andby the thought of a soul that is taking flight.He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly,for she felt herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of somethingineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in hiseyes which she could not see.Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Hadit not been for this tree, she would have fallen.Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard,barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:--"Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not live on as I wasliving, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the bench?Do you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. It is a long time, youremember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near theGladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on the 16th ofJune and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not seen youfor a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and shetold me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, onthe third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,--you see thatI know! I followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then youdisappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading thenewspapers under the arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you. But no. Itwas a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Donot be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows nearat hand. I walk very softly, so that you may not hear, for you might bealarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled.Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did it affect you because Iheard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt you. No,it is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come sometimes; I thinkthat I am going to die. If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, Ispeak to you, but I do not know what I am saying; I may have displeasedyou; have I displeased you?""Oh! my mother!" said she.And she sank down as though on the point of death.He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close,without knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he wastottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke;lightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to himthat he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was committinga profanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovelywoman whose force he felt against his breast. He was beside himself withlove.She took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, hestammered:--"You love me, then?"She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than abarely audible breath:--"Hush! Thou knowest it!"And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb andintoxicated young man.He fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. Thestars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lipsmet? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, thatthe rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind theblack trees on the shivering crest of the hills?A kiss, and that was all.Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the dampearth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their heartswere full of thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously.She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,and how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to herthat he should be there!From time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, and bothshivered.At intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her lipslike a drop of dew on a flower.Little by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followedsilence, which is fulness. The night was serene and splendid overhead.These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, theirdreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras, theirweaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they hadlonged for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see eachother. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothingcould augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. Theyrelated to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, all thatlove, youth, and the remains of childhood which still lingered aboutthem, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts poured themselves outinto each other in such wise, that at the expiration of a quarter of anhour, it was the young man who had the young girl's soul, and the younggirl who had the young man's soul. Each became permeated with the other,they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, shelaid her head on his shoulder and asked him:--"What is your name?""My name is Marius," said he. "And yours?""My name is Cosette."BOOK SIXTH.--LITTLE GAVROCHECHAPTER I--THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WINDSince 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreckand was being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, butin the cesspool of petty debts, the Thenardier pair had had two otherchildren; both males. That made five; two girls and three boys.Madame Thenardier had got rid of the last two, while they were stillyoung and very small, with remarkable luck.Got rid of is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in thatwoman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than one exampleextant. Like the Marechale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thenardier wasa mother to her daughters only. There her maternity ended. Her hatred ofthe human race began with her own sons. In the direction of her sons herevil disposition was uncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious wallin that quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested the eldest; shecursed the other two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, themost unanswerable of retorts--Because. "I have no need of a litter ofsqualling brats," said this mother.Let us explain how the Thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of theirlast two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was thesame one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the twochildren which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at thecorner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her theopportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader willremember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districtsof the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science tookadvantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy ofinhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day by theexternal tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost bothher boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the otherin the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children wereprecious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. Theseeighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, bycollector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue duRoi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnonsought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which sheformed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lendmutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thenardiers had two.The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a goodinvestment for the other. The little Thenardiers became little Magnons.Magnon quitted the Quai des Celestins and went to live in the RueClocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himselfis broken between one street and another.The registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, andthe substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world.Only, the Thenardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs amonth, which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay.It is unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to performhis compact. He came to see the children every six months. He did notperceive the change. "Monsieur," Magnon said to him, "how much theyresemble you!"Thenardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion to becomeJondrette. His two daughters and Gavroche had hardly had time todiscover that they had two little brothers. When a certain degreeof misery is reached, one is overpowered with a sort of spectralindifference, and one regards human beings as though they were spectres.Your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowyforms, barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easilyconfounded again with the invisible.On the evening of the day when she had handed over her two littleones to Magnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, theThenardier had felt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said to herhusband: "But this is abandoning our children!" Thenardier, masterfuland phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying: "Jean JacquesRousseau did even better!" From scruples, the mother proceeded touneasiness: "But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, MonsieurThenardier, is what we have done permissible?" Thenardier replied:"Everything is permissible. No one will see anything but true blue init. Besides, no one has any interest in looking closely after childrenwho have not a sou."Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She wascareful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnishedin an affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized Englishthief. This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne,recommended by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with themedals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mar's diamonds, became celebratedlater on in judicial accounts. She was called Mamselle Miss.The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason tocomplain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were wellcared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; they wereneither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like"little gentlemen,"--better by their false mother than by their realone. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves' slang in theirpresence.Thus passed several years. Thenardier augured well from the fact. Oneday, he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipendof ten francs: "The father must give them some education."All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time beenprotected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurledinto life and forced to begin it for themselves.A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations,is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter-societywhich pursues its existence beneath public society; an adventure of thisdescription entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world. TheThenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon.One day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Eponine the noterelating to the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in theRue Clocheperce; Magnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; and allthe inhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, weregathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little boys wereplaying in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they triedto enter the house again, they found the door fastened and the houseempty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them apaper which "their mother" had left for them. On this paper there was anaddress: M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No. 8. Theproprietor of the stall said to them: "You cannot live here any longer.Go there. It is near by. The first street on the left. Ask your way fromthis paper."The children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in hishand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbedlittle fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a verygood hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust ofwind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was not ableto find it again.They began to wander aimlessly through the streets.CHAPTER II--IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THEGREATSpring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes whichdo not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which saddenthe most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs ofcold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fittingdoor or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter hadremained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In thespring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this centurybroke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh and piercingthan ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of winter whichwas ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt thebreath of the cholera.From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed thispeculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.Frequent storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth atthis epoch.One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree thatJanuary seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed theircloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his rags,was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker's shop in thevicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman'swoollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had convertedinto a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intentadmiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned withorange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying hersmile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in reality, he wastaking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether hecould not "prig" from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would thenproceed to sell for a sou to a "hair-dresser" in the suburbs. He hadoften managed to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his species ofwork, for which he possessed special aptitude, "shaving barbers."While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he mutteredbetween his teeth: "Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Perhapsit was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday."No one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the lastoccasion on which he had dined, three days before, for it was nowFriday.The barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shavinga customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, thatfreezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in hispockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsorsoap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and stillsmaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age, the otherfive, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a request forsomething or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur which resembleda groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once, and their wordswere unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger, and theteeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The barber wheeled roundwith a furious look, and without abandoning his razor, thrust back theelder with his left hand and the younger with his knee, and slammedhis door, saying: "The idea of coming in and freezing everybody fornothing!"The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloudhad risen; it had begun to rain.Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:--"What's the matter with you, brats?""We don't know where we are to sleep," replied the elder."Is that all?" said Gavroche. "A great matter, truly. The idea ofbawling about that. They must be greenies!"And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was ratherbantering, an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:--"Come along with me, young 'uns!""Yes, sir," said the elder.And the two children followed him as they would have followed anarchbishop. They had stopped crying.Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of theBastille.As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at thebarber's shop."That fellow has no heart, the whiting,"[35] he muttered. "He's anEnglishman."A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, withGavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh waswanting in respect towards the group."Good day, Mamselle Omnibus," said Gavroche to her.An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and headded:--"I am making a mistake in the beast; he's not a whiting, he's a serpent.Barber, I'll go and fetch a locksmith, and I'll have a bell hung to yourtail."This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter,he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on theBrocken, and who had a broom in her hand."Madam," said he, "so you are going out with your horse?"And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian."You scamp!" shouted the furious pedestrian.Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl."Is Monsieur complaining?""Of you!" ejaculated the man."The office is closed," said Gavroche, "I do not receive any morecomplaints."In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived abeggar-girl, thirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short agown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled under aporte-cochere. The little girl was getting to be too old for such athing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at themoment when nudity becomes indecent."Poor girl!" said Gavroche. "She hasn't even trousers. Hold on, takethis."And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck,he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, wherethe scarf became a shawl once more.The child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl insilence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in hismisery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returnsthanks for good.That done: "Brrr!" said Gavroche, who was shivering more than SaintMartin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.At this brrr! the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, becamefurious. The wicked skies punish good deeds."Ah, come now!" exclaimed Gavroche, "what's the meaning of this? It'sre-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop mysubscription."And he set out on the march once more."It's all right," he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, asshe coiled up under the shawl, "she's got a famous peel."And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:--"Caught!"The two children followed close on his heels.As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicatea baker's shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turnedround:--"Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?""Monsieur," replied the elder, "we have had nothing to eat since thismorning.""So you have neither father nor mother?" resumed Gavroche majestically."Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don't know wherethey are.""Sometimes that's better than knowing where they are," said Gavroche,who was a thinker."We have been wandering about these two hours," continued the elder, "wehave hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have foundnothing.""I know," ejaculated Gavroche, "it's the dogs who eat everything."He went on, after a pause:--"Ah! we have lost our authors. We don't know what we have done withthem. This should not be, gamins. It's stupid to let old people strayoff like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same."However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that theyshould have no dwelling place!The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered theprompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:--"It's queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get ablessed spray on Palm Sunday.""Bosh," said Gavroche."Mamma," resumed the elder, "is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.""Tanflute!" retorted Gavroche.Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had beenfeeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied,but which was triumphant, in reality."Let us be calm, young 'uns. Here's supper for three."And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both ofthem before him into the baker's shop, and flung his sou on the counter,crying:--"Boy! five centimes' worth of bread."The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a knife."In three pieces, my boy!" went on Gavroche.And he added with dignity:--"There are three of us."And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, hadtaken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose withan inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the greatFrederick's snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignantapostrophe full in the baker's face:--"Keksekca?"Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellationof Gavroche's to the baker a Russian or a Polish word, or one of thosesavage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other frombank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are warned that it is aword which they [our readers] utter every day, and which takes the placeof the phrase: "Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela?" The baker understoodperfectly, and replied:--"Well! It's bread, and very good bread of the second quality.""You mean larton brutal [black bread]!" retorted Gavroche, calmly andcoldly disdainful. "White bread, boy! white bread [larton savonne]! I'mstanding treat."The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread hesurveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche."Come, now, baker's boy!" said he, "what are you taking our measure likethat for?"All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, andGavroche said to the two children:--"Grub away."The little boys stared at him in surprise.Gavroche began to laugh."Ah! hullo, that's so! they don't understand yet, they're too small."And he repeated:--"Eat away."At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy ofhis conversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to berelieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as behanded him the largest share:--"Ram that into your muzzle."One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore theirbread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the baker,who, now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them."Let's go into the street again," said Gavroche.They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallesthalted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended fromhis neck by a cord."Well, he is a very green 'un," said Gavroche.Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:--"All the same, if I had charge of the babes I'd lock 'em up better thanthat."Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached theangle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the lowand threatening wicket of La Force was visible:--"Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?" said some one."Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?" said Gavroche.A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no otherthan Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable toGavroche."The bow-wows!" went on Gavroche, "you've got a hide the color of alinseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor. You're putting on style,'pon my word!""Hush!" ejaculated Montparnasse, "not so loud."And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by thehand.When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere, shelteredfrom the rain and from all eyes:--"Do you know where I'm going?" demanded Montparnasse."To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,"[36] replied Gavroche."Joker!"And Montparnasse went on:--"I'm going to find Babet.""Ah!" exclaimed Gavroche, "so her name is Babet."Montparnasse lowered his voice:--"Not she, he.""Ah! Babet.""Yes, Babet.""I thought he was buckled.""He has undone the buckle," replied Montparnasse.And he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that veryday, Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made hisescape, by turning to the left instead of to the right in "the policeoffice."Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill."What a dentist!" he cried.Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet's flight, and ended with:--"Oh! That's not all."Gavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse held inhis hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of adagger made its appearance."Ah!" he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, "you have broughtalong your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois."Montparnasse winked."The deuce!" resumed Gavroche, "so you're going to have a bout with thebobbies?""You can't tell," replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. "It'salways a good thing to have a pin about one."Gavroche persisted:--"What are you up to to-night?"Again Montparnasse took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every syllable:"Things."And abruptly changing the conversation:--"By the way!""What?""Something happened t'other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makesme a present of a sermon and his purse. I put it in my pocket. A minutelater, I feel in my pocket. There's nothing there.""Except the sermon," said Gavroche."But you," went on Montparnasse, "where are you bound for now?"Gavroche pointed to his two proteges, and said:--"I'm going to put these infants to bed.""Whereabouts is the bed?""At my house.""Where's your house?""At my house.""So you have a lodging?""Yes, I have.""And where is your lodging?""In the elephant," said Gavroche.Montparnasse, though not naturally inclined to astonishment, could notrestrain an exclamation."In the elephant!""Well, yes, in the elephant!" retorted Gavroche. "Kekcaa?"This is another word of the language which no one writes, and whichevery one speaks.Kekcaa signifies: Quest que c'est que cela a? [What's the matter withthat?]The urchin's profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness andgood sense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard toGavroche's lodging."Of course," said he, "yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?""Very," said Gavroche. "It's really bully there. There ain't anydraughts, as there are under the bridges.""How do you get in?""Oh, I get in.""So there is a hole?" demanded Montparnasse."Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn't tell. It's between the forelegs. The bobbies haven't seen it.""And you climb up? Yes, I understand.""A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it's all over, no one there."After a pause, Gavroche added:--"I shall have a ladder for these children."Montparnasse burst out laughing:--"Where the devil did you pick up those young 'uns?"Gavroche replied with great simplicity:--"They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of."Meanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:--"You recognized me very readily," he muttered.He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more thantwo quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils.This gave him a different nose."That changes you," remarked Gavroche, "you are less homely so, youought to keep them on all the time."Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease."Seriously," demanded Montparnasse, "how do you like me so?"The sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnassehad become unrecognizable."Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!" exclaimed Gavroche.The two children, who had not been listening up to this point, beingoccupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drewnear at this name, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy andadmiration.Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.He laid his hand on Gavroche's shoulder, and said to him, emphasizinghis words: "Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square withmy dog, my knife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten sous onme, I wouldn't refuse to work, but this isn't Shrove Tuesday."This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeledround hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profoundattention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back tothem a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: "Ah! good!" to escape him,but immediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasse's hand:--"Well, good evening," said he, "I'm going off to my elephant with mybrats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come andhunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You willinquire for Monsieur Gavroche.""Very good," said Montparnasse.And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction ofthe Greve, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five,dragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned hishead back several times to watch "Porrichinelle" as he went.The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavrocheof the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman thanthe assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms. Thissyllable, dig, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words ofa phrase, means: "Take care, we can no longer talk freely." There wasbesides, in Montparnasse's sentence, a literary beauty which waslost upon Gavroche, that is mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue, a slangexpression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my wife,greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great centurywhen Moliere wrote and Callot drew.Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner ofthe Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in theancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which hasalready been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deservedto leave some trace, for it was the idea of a "member of the Institute,the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt."We say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this modelitself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea ofNapoleon's, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown,on each occasion, still further from us, had become historical and hadacquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisionalaspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber andmasonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerlypainted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind,and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place, thebroad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, hisenormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, underthe starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort ofsymbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It wassome mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect besidethe invisible spectre of the Bastille.Few strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It wasfalling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itselffrom its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. "The aediles," as theexpression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814.There it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surroundedby a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracksmeandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grassflourished between its legs; and, as the level of the place had beenrising all around it for a space of thirty years, by that slow andcontinuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns,it stood in a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving waybeneath it. It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in theeyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There wassomething about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out,and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated.As we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is the real elementof everything that is dark. As soon as twilight descended, the oldelephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil and redoubtableappearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows. Being of the past,he belonged to night; and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur.This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but assuredlymajestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and savagegravity, has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of giganticstove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre fortresswith its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudalclasses. It is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of anepoch in which a pot contains power. This epoch will pass away, peoplehave already begun to understand that, if there can be force in aboiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other words,that which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but ideas.Harness locomotives to ideas,--that is well done; but do not mistake thehorse for the rider.At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architectof this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; thearchitect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out ofbronze.This stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and calledthe column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried,was still enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which weregret, for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed thetask of isolating the elephant.It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflectionof a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two "brats."The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind himthat we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, thetribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage,and mutilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleepin this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended theeffect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small,and said:--"Don't be scared, infants."Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's enclosureand helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The twochildren, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering aword, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags whichhad given them bread and had promised them a shelter.There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day servedthe laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it withremarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant's forelegs.Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the bellyof the colossus could be distinguished.Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said tothem:--"Climb up and go in."The two little boys exchanged terrified glances."You're afraid, brats!" exclaimed Gavroche.And he added:--"You shall see!"He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, withoutdeigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. Heentered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within,and an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,appear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitishspectre."Well!" he exclaimed, "climb up, young 'uns! You'll see how snug it ishere! Come up, you!" he said to the elder, "I'll lend you a hand."The little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspiredthem with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was rainingvery hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing hisbrother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of thishuge beast, felt greatly inclined to cry, but he did not dare.The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder;Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations like afencing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules."Don't be afraid!--That's it!--Come on!--Put your feet there!--Give usyour hand here!--Boldly!"And when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly andvigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him."Nabbed!" said he.The brat had passed through the crack."Now," said Gavroche, "wait for me. Be so good as to take a seat,Monsieur."And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped downthe elephant's leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his feet inthe grass, grasped the child of five round the body, and planted himfairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to climb up behindhim, shouting to the elder:--"I'm going to boost him, do you tug."And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled,thrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself,and Gavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kickwhich sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:--"Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!"This explosion over, he added:--"Now, young 'uns, you are in my house."Gavroche was at home, in fact.Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! Goodnessof giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of theEmperor's, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had beenaccepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out intheir Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fondof saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes:"What's the good of that?" It served to save from the cold, the frost,the hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preservefrom slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in thesnow which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother,no bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whomsociety repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lairopen to one against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though themiserable old mastodon, invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered withwarts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering, worm-eaten, abandoned,condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in vain with abenevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads, had taken pity on thatother mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,without a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fedon rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was goodfor. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back byGod. That which had been merely illustrious, had become august. In orderto realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry, brass,iron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and plastersufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in thatTitanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk uplifted, bearing itstower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters, hewished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with it, hehad lodged a child there.The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which washardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated,beneath the elephant's belly, and so narrow that it was only cats andhomeless children who could pass through it."Let's begin," said Gavroche, "by telling the porter that we are not athome."And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who iswell acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up theaperture.Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard thecrackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemicalmatch was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steelrepresented progress.A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite oneof those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats. Thecellar rat, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the interiorof the elephant confusedly visible.Gavroche's two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which theyexperienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up inthe great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must havefelt in the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeletonappeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence started atregular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebralcolumn with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from them likeentrails, and vast spiders' webs stretching from side to side, formeddirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were visible largeblackish spots which had the appearance of being alive, and whichchanged places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement.Fragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly hadfilled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on afloor.The smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered tohim:--"It's black."This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of thetwo brats rendered some shock necessary."What's that you are gabbling about there?" he exclaimed. "Areyou scoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want thetuileries? Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you that I don't belong tothe regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope'sestablishment?"A little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. The twochildren drew close to Gavroche.Gavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave togentle, and addressing the smaller:--"Stupid," said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressingintonation, "it's outside that it is black. Outside it's raining, hereit does not rain; outside it's cold, here there's not an atom of wind;outside there are heaps of people, here there's no one; outside thereain't even the moon, here there's my candle, confound it!"The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; butGavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation."Quick," said he.And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call theend of the room.There stood his bed.Gavroche's bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, ablanket, and an alcove with curtains.The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip ofgray woollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcoveconsisted of:--Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbishwhich formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, twoin front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as toform a pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of brasswire which was simply placed upon it, but artistically applied, and heldby fastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three holes. A rowof very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothingcould pass under it. This grating was nothing else than a piece of thebrass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche'sbed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The whole resembled anEsquimaux tent.This trellis-work took the place of curtains.Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart."Down on all fours, brats!" said Gavroche.He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawledin after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the openinghermetically again.All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the cellarrat in his hand."Now," said he, "go to sleep! I'm going to suppress the candelabra.""Monsieur," the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to thenetting, "what's that for?""That," answered Gavroche gravely, "is for the rats. Go to sleep!"Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for thebenefit of these young creatures, and he continued:--"It's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It's used for fierce animals.There's a whole shopful of them there. All you've got to do is to climbover a wall, crawl through a window, and pass through a door. You canget as much as you want."As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of theblanket, and the little one murmured:--"Oh! how good that is! It's warm!"Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket."That's from the Jardin des Plantes, too," said he. "I took that fromthe monkeys."And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a verythick and admirably made mat, he added:--"That belonged to the giraffe."After a pause he went on:--"The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn'ttrouble them. I told them: 'It's for the elephant.'"He paused, and then resumed:--"You crawl over the walls and you don't care a straw for the government.So there now!"The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on thisintrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolatedlike themselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirableand all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whosephysiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank,mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles."Monsieur," ventured the elder timidly, "you are not afraid of thepolice, then?"Gavroche contented himself with replying:--"Brat! Nobody says 'police,' they say 'bobbies.'"The smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was onthe edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked theblanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the matunder his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for thechild. Then he turned to the elder:--"Hey! We're jolly comfortable here, ain't we?""Ah, yes!" replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression ofa saved angel.The two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to growwarm once more."Ah, by the way," continued Gavroche, "what were you bawling about?"And pointing out the little one to his brother:--"A mite like that, I've nothing to say about, but the idea of a bigfellow like you crying! It's idiotic; you looked like a calf.""Gracious," replied the child, "we have no lodging.""Bother!" retorted Gavroche, "you don't say 'lodgings,' you say 'crib.'""And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.""You don't say 'night,' you say 'darkmans.'""Thank you, sir," said the child."Listen," went on Gavroche, "you must never bawl again over anything.I'll take care of you. You shall see what fun we'll have. In summer,we'll go to the Glaciere with Navet, one of my pals, we'll bathe inthe Gare, we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge atAusterlitz,--that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they getmad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We'll go and see theman-skeleton. And then I'll take you to the play. I'll take you to seeFrederick Lemaitre. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I evenplayed in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ranunder a cloth, and that made the sea. I'll get you an engagement at mytheatre. We'll go to see the savages. They ain't real, those savagesain't. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can seewhere their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we'll go to theOpera. We'll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is wellmanaged. I wouldn't associate with the claque on the boulevard. At theOpera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they're ninnies.They're called dishclouts. And then we'll go to see the guillotine work.I'll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. MonsieurSanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we'll have famous fun!"At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche's finger, and recalled himto the realities of life."The deuce!" said he, "there's the wick giving out. Attention! I can'tspend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed,he must sleep. We haven't the time to read M. Paul de Kock'sromances. And besides, the light might pass through the cracks of theporte-cochere, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it.""And then," remarked the elder timidly,--he alone dared talk toGavroche, and reply to him, "a spark might fall in the straw, and wemust look out and not burn the house down.""People don't say 'burn the house down,'" remarked Gavroche, "they say'blaze the crib.'"The storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon theback of the colossus amid claps of thunder. "You're taken in, rain!"said Gavroche. "It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs ofthe house. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it losesits labor, it can't wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, oldwater-carrier that it is."This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, inhis character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, wasfollowed by a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of itentered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the sameinstant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little creaturesuttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network came nearbeing displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them, and tookadvantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh."Calm down, children. Don't topple over the edifice. That's fine,first-class thunder; all right. That's no slouch of a streak oflightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It's almost as good asit is at the Ambigu."That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two childrengently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch themout at full length, and exclaimed:--"Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,babes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It's very badnot to sleep. It'll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, infashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in thehide! I'm going to put out the light. Are you ready?""Yes," murmured the elder, "I'm all right. I seem to have feathers undermy head.""People don't say 'head,'" cried Gavroche, "they say 'nut'."The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finishedarranging them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, thenrepeated, for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:--"Shut your peepers!"And he snuffed out his tiny light.Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling beganto affect the netting under which the three children lay.It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallicsound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This wasaccompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, andchilled with terror, jogged his brother's elbow; but the elder brotherhad already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the littleone, who could no longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but ina very low tone, and with bated breath:--"Sir?""Hey?" said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes."What is that?""It's the rats," replied Gavroche.And he laid his head down on the mat again.The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of theelephant, and who were the living black spots which we have alreadymentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long asit had been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the sameas their city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the goodstory-teller Perrault calls "fresh meat," they had hurled themselves inthrongs on Gavroche's tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begunto bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.Still the little one could not sleep."Sir?" he began again."Hey?" said Gavroche."What are rats?""They are mice."This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice inthe course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, helifted up his voice once more."Sir?""Hey?" said Gavroche again."Why don't you have a cat?""I did have one," replied Gavroche, "I brought one here, but they ateher."This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the littlefellow began to tremble again.The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:--"Monsieur?""Hey?""Who was it that was eaten?""The cat.""And who ate the cat?""The rats.""The mice?""Yes, the rats."The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which atecats, pursued:--"Sir, would those mice eat us?""Wouldn't they just!" ejaculated Gavroche.The child's terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:--"Don't be afraid. They can't get in. And besides, I'm here! Here, catchhold of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers!"At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow's hand across hisbrother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.Courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicatingthemselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of theirvoices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,they came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fastasleep and heard nothing more.The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de laBastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, thepatrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks,and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silencebefore the elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyedinto the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over his gooddeed; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleepingchildren.In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader mustremember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated atthe other end of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity ofthe elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, aman turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of theenclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until hewas underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had illuminatedthat man, it might have been divined from the thorough manner in whichhe was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneaththe elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to anyhuman tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice herepeated this cry, of whose orthography the following barely conveys anidea:--"Kirikikiou!"At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the bellyof the elephant:--"Yes!"Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside,and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg, and fellbriskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.As for his cry of Kirikikiou,--that was, doubtless, what the child hadmeant, when he said:--"You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche."On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his"alcove," pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing ittogether again, then he had opened the trap, and descended.The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:Montparnasse confined himself to the remark:--"We need you. Come, lend us a hand."The lad asked for no further enlightenment."I'm with you," said he.And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whenceMontparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file ofmarket-gardeners' carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid thesalads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflerson account of the beating rain, did not even glance at these strangepedestrians.CHAPTER III--THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHTThis is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:--An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, andThenardier, although Thenardier was in close confinement. Babet hadarranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the readerhas seen from Montparnasse's account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was tohelp them from outside.Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had hadtime, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature aplan. In former times, those severe places where the discipline of theprison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of fourstone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a gratedwindow, and a door lined with iron, and were called dungeons; but thedungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of aniron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stonewalls, and a stone ceiling, and are called chambers of punishment. Alittle light penetrates towards mid-day. The inconvenient point aboutthese chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that theyallow the persons who should be at work to think.So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment witha rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagnecourtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he foundin the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, thatis to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom itis high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with anappearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, apolished, intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance,and an atrocious smile. His glance resulted from his will, and hissmile from his nature. His first studies in his art had been directedto roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who tearoff lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the processcalled double pickings.The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarlyfavorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-layingand re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on theprison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolatedfrom the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there werescaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in thedirection of liberty.The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to beseen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The wallswere eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had beenobliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood,because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling onthe prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the authoritiescommitted the error of confining in the New Building the mosttroublesome prisoners, of placing there "the hard cases," as they say inprison parlance.The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and atop story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine Air). A large chimney-flue,probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, startedfrom the groundfloor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories,where it figured as a flattened pillar, into two portions, and finallypierced the roof.Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, byway of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads oftheir beds should rest against the chimney.Thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story known asFine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochereof the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubsin wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little whiterotunda with two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolicdream of Jean Jacques.Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormousblack, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.This was the outer wall of La Force.This wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin.Lofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof, whichcould be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building. Thereone could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they were thewindows of the Fine-Air.A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed thedormitories.The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of largehall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings and double doorsof sheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. When one enteredfrom the north end, one had on one's left the four dormer-windows, onone's right, facing the windows, at regular intervals, four square,tolerably vast cages, separated by narrow passages, built of masonryto about the height of the elbow, and the rest, up to the roof, of ironbars.Thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages sincethe night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how,and by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting abottle of wine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with whicha narcotic is mixed, and which the band of the Endormeurs, orSleep-compellers, rendered famous.There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers,half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police anunfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lostchildren, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped thatmorning, was waiting for them in the street as well as Montparnasse,rose softly, and with the nail which Brujon had found, began to piercethe chimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish fell on Brujon'sbed, so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with thunder shookthe doors on their hinges, and created in the prison a terrible andopportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fallasleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices. Brujonwas adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached thewatcher, who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into thedormitory, the wall had, been pierced, the chimney scaled, the irongrating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced, and the tworedoubtable ruffians were on the roof. The wind and rain redoubled, theroof was slippery."What a good night to leg it!" said Brujon.An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from thesurrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the musketof a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of therope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron barswhich they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the outer wall,crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the wall, gotastride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other, along the rope,upon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled their rope afterthem, jumped down into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it,pushed open the porter's wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulledthis, opened the porte-cochere, and found themselves in the street.Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed inthe dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who wereprowling about the neighborhood.They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of itremained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained noother damage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin offtheir hands.That night, Thenardier was warned, without any one being able to explainhow, and was not asleep.Towards one o'clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he sawtwo shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front ofthe dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the window,long enough to dart in a glance. This was Brujon.Thenardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.Thenardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precautionunder the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force, waskept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, marchedup and down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The Fine-Air waslighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet fetters weighingfifty pounds. Every day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, a jailer,escorted by two dogs,--this was still in vogue at that time,--enteredhis cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing twopounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, inwhich swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons and tapped the bars.This man and his dogs made two visits during the night.Thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which heused to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, "in order to preserveit from the rats," as he said. As Thenardier was kept in sight,no objection had been made to this spike. Still, it was rememberedafterwards, that one of the jailers had said: "It would be better to lethim have only a wooden spike."At two o'clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, wasrelieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man withthe dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything, except,possibly, the excessive youth and "the rustic air" of the "raw recruit."Two hours afterwards, at four o'clock, when they came to relieve theconscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log nearThenardier's cage. As for Thenardier, he was no longer there. There wasa hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in theroof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, and probablycarried away with him, as it was not found. They also seized in his cella half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying winewith which the soldier had been drugged. The soldier's bayonet haddisappeared.At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed thatThenardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in theNew Building, but that he was still in great danger.Thenardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found theremains of Brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of thechimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, he had notbeen able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile,one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood onthat spot, in the last century, a house of which only the back wall nowremains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of thethird story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be recognizedby two large square windows which are still to be seen there; the middleone, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beamadjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was formerly visible alofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of LaForce.The empty space on the street left by the demolished house ishalf-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts.In this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against theportion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence has a gate,which, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch.It was the crest of this ruin that Thenardier had succeeded in reaching,a little after one o'clock in the morning.How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explainor understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hinderedand helped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of theslaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, fromcompartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court,then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, andthence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerarythere existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Hadhe placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of theFine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the copingof the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut?But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line;it mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen's barracks, it rosetowards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by buildings, it was noteven of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavee;everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then, the sentinels musthave espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken byThenardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight wasimpossible. Had Thenardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty whichchanges precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, alegless man into an athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity intoinstinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, hadThenardier invented a third mode? No one has ever found out.The marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man who makeshis escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star andof the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towardsdeliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime,and one says of the escaped thief: "How did he contrive to scale thatwall?" in the same way that one says of Corneille: "Where did he findthe means of dying?"At all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, with hisclothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, hisknees torn, Thenardier had reached what children, in their figurativelanguage, call the edge of the wall of the ruin, there he had stretchedhimself out at full length, and there his strength had failed him. Asteep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement ofthe street.The rope which he had was too short.There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair whichhe had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself thatthe day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing theneighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, anhour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be foundasleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth, atthe light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavementlonged for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty.He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded,if they had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. Helistened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed throughthe street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent ofthe market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes,and from Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the RueSaint-Antoine.Four o'clock struck. Thenardier shuddered. A few moments later, thatterrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escapebroke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, thecreaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, thehoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavementof the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past thegrated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole ofthe top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in the barrackson the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which the torch lightedup in the rain, went and came along the roofs. At the same time,Thenardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan whitenesslighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavyrains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to thegiddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest,and his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of theseideas to the other: "Dead if I fall, caught if I stay." In the midst ofthis anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man whowas gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavee, halt in therecess above which Thenardier was, as it were, suspended. Here thisman was joined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then bya third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of themlifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four enteredthe enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly underThenardier. These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in orderthat they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by thesentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. Itmust be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.Thenardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear totheir words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himselflost.Thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before hiseyes,--these men conversed in slang.The first said in a low but distinct voice:--"Let's cut. What are we up to here?"The second replied: "It's raining hard enough to put out the verydevil's fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There's a soldieron guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here."These two words, icigo and icicaille, both of which mean ici, and whichbelong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the slangof the Temple, were flashes of light for Thenardier. By the icigo herecognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by the icicaillehe knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an old-clothesbroker at the Temple.The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except inthe Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in allits purity. Had it not been for the icicaille, Thenardier would not haverecognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened."There's no hurry yet, let's wait a bit. How do we know that he doesn'tstand in need of us?"By this, which was nothing but French, Thenardier recognizedMontparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand allslangs and to speak none of them.As for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayedhim. Thenardier did not hesitate. It was Guelemer.Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:--"What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn't managed to cuthis stick. He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't! You have to bea pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to makea rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make false keys, fileyour irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, and disguise yourself!The old fellow hasn't managed to play it, he doesn't understand how towork the business."Babet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken byPoulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly coloredand risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to thelanguage of Andre Chenier:--"Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to beknowing. He's only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken inby a bobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal.Listen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You haveseen all those lights. He's recaptured, there! He'll get off with twentyyears. I ain't afraid, I ain't a coward, but there ain't anything moreto do, or otherwise they'd lead us a dance. Don't get mad, come with us,let's go drink a bottle of old wine together.""One doesn't desert one's friends in a scrape," grumbled Montparnasse."I tell you he's nabbed!" retorted Brujon. "At the present moment, theinn-keeper ain't worth a ha'penny. We can't do nothing for him. Let's beoff. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist."Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the factis, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandoneach other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as wastheir peril, in the hope of seeing Thenardier make his appearance on thetop of some wall. But the night, which was really growing too fine,--forthe downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted,--the coldwhich was overpowering them, their soaked garments, their hole-riddenshoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison, thehours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had encountered, thehope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a retreat. Montparnassehimself, who was, perhaps, almost Thenardier's son-in-law, yielded. Amoment more, and they would be gone. Thenardier was panting on his walllike the shipwrecked sufferers of the Meduse on their raft when theybeheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon.He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. Anidea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; he drew fromhis pocket the end of Brujon's rope, which he had detached from thechimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by thefence.This rope fell at their feet."A widow,"[37] said Babet."My tortouse!"[38] said Brujon."The tavern-keeper is there," said Montparnasse.They raised their eyes. Thenardier thrust out his head a very little."Quick!" said Montparnasse, "have you the other end of the rope,Brujon?""Yes.""Knot the two pieces together, we'll fling him the rope, he can fastenit to the wall, and he'll have enough of it to get down with."Thenardier ran the risk, and spoke:--"I am paralyzed with cold.""We'll warm you up.""I can't budge.""Let yourself slide, we'll catch you.""My hands are benumbed.""Only fasten the rope to the wall.""I can't.""Then one of us must climb up," said Montparnasse."Three stories!" ejaculated Brujon.An ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that had been usedin the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted almostto the very spot where they could see Thenardier. This flue, then muchdamaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks of it arestill visible.It was very narrow."One might get up by the help of that," said Montparnasse."By that flue?" exclaimed Babet, "a grown-up cove, never! it would takea brat.""A brat must be got," resumed Brujon."Where are we to find a young 'un?" said Guelemer."Wait," said Montparnasse. "I've got the very article."He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one waspassing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behindhim, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.Seven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thenardier;Babet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gateopened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed byGavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of theseruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair.Guelemer addressed him:--"Are you a man, young 'un?"Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:--"A young 'un like me's a man, and men like you are babes.""The brat's tongue's well hung!" exclaimed Babet."The Paris brat ain't made of straw," added Brujon."What do you want?" asked Gavroche.Montparnasse answered:--"Climb up that flue.""With this rope," said Babet."And fasten it," continued Brujon."To the top of the wall," went on Babet."To the cross-bar of the window," added Brujon."And then?" said Gavroche."There!" said Guelemer.The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and madethat indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies:--"Is that all!""There's a man up there whom you are to save," resumed Montparnasse."Will you?" began Brujon again."Greenhorn!" replied the lad, as though the question appeared a mostunprecedented one to him.And he took off his shoes.Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's weight, and handedhim the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse'sabsence. The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it waseasy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At themoment when he was on the point of ascending, Thenardier, who saw lifeand safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first lightof dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his lividcheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, andGavroche recognized him."Hullo! it's my father! Oh, that won't hinder."And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it hadbeen a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of thewindow.A moment later, Thenardier was in the street.As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself outof danger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; theterrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, all thatstrange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood erect and free,ready to march onward.These were this man's first words:--"Now, whom are we to eat?"It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparentremark, which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder. Toeat, true sense: to devour."Let's get well into a corner," said Brujon. "Let's settle it in threewords, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in theRue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate ona garden, and lone women.""Well! why not?" demanded Thenardier."Your girl, Eponine, went to see about the matter," replied Babet."And she brought a biscuit to Magnon," added Guelemer. "Nothing to bemade there.""The girl's no fool," said Thenardier. "Still, it must be seen to.""Yes, yes," said Brujon, "it must be looked up."In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, duringthis colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waiteda few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him,then he put on his shoes again, and said:--"Is that all? You don't want any more, my men? Now you're out of yourscrape. I'm off. I must go and get my brats out of bed."And off he went.The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets,Babet took Thenardier aside."Did you take a good look at that young 'un?" he asked."What young 'un?""The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.""Not particularly.""Well, I don't know, but it strikes me that it was your son.""Bah!" said Thenardier, "do you think so?"BOOK SEVENTH.--SLANG[Illustration: Slang b7-1-slang]CHAPTER I--ORIGINPigritia is a terrible word.It engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft, and a hell,la pegrenne, for which read hunger.Thus, idleness is the mother.She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.Where are we at this moment?

It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;it is theft in its two kinds; people and language.When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombrehistory introduced into a work written with the same aim as this[39] athief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.--"What! How!Argot! Why, argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons, galleys,convicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!" etc., etc.We have never understood this sort of objections.Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profoundobserver of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the people,Balzac and Eugene Sue, having represented their ruffians as talkingtheir natural language, as the author of The Last Day of a CondemnedMan did in 1828, the same objections have been raised. People repeated:"What do authors mean by that revolting dialect? Slang is odious! Slangmakes one shudder!"Who denies that? Of course it does.When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since whenhas it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We havealways thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, asimple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which dutyaccepted and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything,and study everything? Why should one halt on the way? The halt is amatter depending on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task toundertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order,where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage inthose vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling, stillquivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping withfilth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary eachword of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and theshadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus inits nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming ofslang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for thenight which has just been torn from its cesspool. One thinks one beholdsa frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles,wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares. One word resembles aclaw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phraseseems to move like the claw of a crab. All this is alive withthe hideous vitality of things which have been organized out ofdisorganization.Now, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady banishedmedicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, thebat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who wouldcast them back into their darkness, saying: "Oh! how ugly that is!" Thethinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeonwho should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be likea philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopherhesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it must be statedto those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literaryphenomenon and a social result. What is slang, properly speaking? It isthe language of wretchedness.We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which isone way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions,it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and allforms of intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says:"Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality," the broker on 'changewho says: "Assets at end of current month," the gambler who says: "Tierset tout, refait de pique," the sheriff of the Norman Isles who says:"The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim thefruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estateby the mortgagor," the playwright who says: "The piece was hissed,"the comedian who says: "I've made a hit," the philosopher who says:"Phenomenal triplicity," the huntsman who says: "Voileci allais,Voileci fuyant," the phrenologist who says: "Amativeness, combativeness,secretiveness," the infantry soldier who says: "My shooting-iron," thecavalry-man who says: "My turkey-cock," the fencing-master who says:"Tierce, quarte, break," the printer who says: "My shooting-stick andgalley,"--all, printer, fencing-master, cavalry dragoon, infantry-man,phrenologist, huntsman, philosopher, comedian, playwright, sheriff,gambler, stock-broker, and merchant, speak slang. The painter who says:"My grinder," the notary who says: "My Skip-the-Gutter," the hairdresserwho says: "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: "My cub," talks slang.Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the point, all thedifferent fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor's portand starboard, the scene-shifter's court-side, and garden-side, thebeadle's Gospel-side and Epistle-side, are slang. There is the slang ofthe affected lady as well as of the precieuses. The Hotel Rambouilletnearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles. There is a slang of duchesses,witness this phrase contained in a love-letter from a very great ladyand a very pretty woman of the Restoration: "You will find in thisgossip a fultitude of reasons why I should libertize."[40] Diplomaticciphers are slang; the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome,grkztntgzyal for despatch, and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI. for the Due deModena, speaks slang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, forcarrot, radish, and turnip, said Opoponach, perfroschinum,reptitalmus, dracatholicum, angelorum, postmegorum, talked slang. Thesugar-manufacturer who says: "Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common,burnt,"--this honest manufacturer talks slang. A certain school ofcriticism twenty years ago, which used to say: "Half of the works ofShakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,"--talked slang. Thepoet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designateM. de Montmorency as "a bourgeois," if he were not a judge of verses andstatues, speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora,"fruits, "Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms,"a horse, "a courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose ofBellona," the three-cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classicalAcademician talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each theirslang. The tongue which is employed on board ship, that wonderfullanguage of the sea, which is so complete and so picturesque, which wasspoken by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperre, which mingles withthe whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, theshock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale,the cannon, is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to thefierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal.No doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the wordslang is an extension which every one will not admit. For our part,we reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed anddetermined significance, and we restrict slang to slang. The veritableslang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two words can becoupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothingelse, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous,cruel, equivocal, vile, profound, fatal tongue of wretchedness. Thereexists, at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes, a lastmisery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflictwith the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights; a fearfulconflict, where, now cunning, now violent, unhealthy and ferociousat one and the same time, it attacks the social order with pin-pricksthrough vice, and with club-blows through crime. To meet the needs ofthis conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which isslang.To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, wereit but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would,otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, ofwhich civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extendthe records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself. Thisservice Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making twoCarthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered,by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts ofdialects. Here objections spring up afresh. Phoenician, very good!Levantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They are tongueswhich have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! What is the useof preserving slang? What is the good of assisting slang "to survive"?To this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which anation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the languagewhich has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention andstudy.It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, formore than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possiblehuman misery.And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities andinfirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy,is not a business in which choice is permitted. The historian of mannersand ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events.The latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of crowns, thebirths of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, greatpublic men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior;the other historian has the interior, the depths, the people who toil,suffer, wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the secret warbetween man and man, obscure ferocities, prejudices, plottediniquities, the subterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, thedie-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution ofsouls, the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans,the unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms which roam through thedarkness. He must descend with his heart full of charity, and severityat the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those impenetrablecasemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed and those who deal theblow, those who weep and those who curse, those who fast and thosewho devour, those who endure evil and those who inflict it. Have thesehistorians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historiansof external facts? Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewerthings to say than Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization anyless important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and moresombre? Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquaintedwith the cavern?Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of whatprecedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classesof historians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a goodhistorian of the patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples,if he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the historianof their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of theinterior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of theexterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the historyof events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute two differentorders of facts which correspond to each other, which are alwaysinterlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineamentswhich providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels,sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depthsproduce ebullitions on the surface. True history being a mixture of allthings, the true historian mingles in everything.Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a doublefocus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.Slang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having somebad action to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself inword-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible.One finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, thegreat human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retortupon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory ofevil. It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps on the crutch of theCourt of Miracles, a crutch metamorphosable into a club; it is calledvagrancy; every sort of spectre, its dressers, have painted its face, itcrawls and rears, the double gait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is aptat all roles, it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered withverdigris by the forger, blacked by the soot of the incendiary; and themurderer applies its rouge.When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside.One distinguishes questions and replies. One perceives, withoutunderstanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents,but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. It is slang.The words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantasticbestiality. One thinks one hears hydras talking.It is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes and whispers, completingthe gloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, it is blacker stillin crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang. Obscurityin the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices. Terrible,toad-like tongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, andstirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rainand night, of hunger, of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, ofsuffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.Let us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? Whoam I who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? And areyou very sure that we have done nothing before we were born? The earthis not devoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is not arecaptured offender against divine justice? Look closely at life. It isso made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.Are you what is called a happy man? Well! you are sad every day. Eachday has its own great grief or its little care. Yesterday you weretrembling for a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear for yourown; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrowthe diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of somefriend; then the prevailing weather, then something that has been brokenor lost, then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebralcolumn reproach you; again, the course of public affairs. This withoutreckoning in the pains of the heart. And so it goes on. One cloud isdispelled, another forms. There is hardly one day out of a hundred whichis wholly joyous and sunny. And you belong to that small class who arehappy! As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate andthe unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another,there are no fortunate.The real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To diminishthe number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--thatis the object. That is why we cry: Education! science! To teach reading,means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. People sufferin the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burnwithout ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer.The day is born in tears. The luminous weep, if only over those indarkness.CHAPTER II--ROOTSSlang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is biddento its most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmaticdialect at once so blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisementmade visible. Every syllable has an air of being marked. The words ofthe vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were,beneath the hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking.Such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of athief branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare.Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which arefugitives from justice. Metaphor is sometimes so shameless, that onefeels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.Moreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strangedialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial caseof pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well asfor the gold medal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether thepublic admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry. It is alanguage. Yes, by the deformity of certain terms, we recognize thefact that it was chewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certainmetonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it.That exquisite and celebrated verse--          Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?          But where are the snows of years gone by?is a verse of slang. Antam--ante annum--is a word of Thunes slang, whichsignified the past year, and by extension, formerly. Thirty-five yearsago, at the epoch of the departure of the great chain-gang, there couldbe read in one of the cells at Bicetre, this maxim engraved with anail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to the galleys: Les dabsd'antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du Coesre. This means Kings indays gone by always went and had themselves anointed. In the opinion ofthat king, anointment meant the galleys.The word decarade, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles ata gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. This word,which strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a masterlyonomatopoeia the whole of La Fontaine's admirable verse:--          Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche.          Six stout horses drew a coach.From a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove morecurious and fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole languagewithin a language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graftwhich has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in theold Gallic trunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side ofthe language. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar aspect ofslang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be studied, thatis to say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears like a veritablealluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer or shorter distanceinto it, one finds in slang, below the old popular French, Provencal,Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean ports,English and German, the Romance language in its three varieties, French,Italian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. Aprofound and unique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in commonby all the miserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, eachsuffering has dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed itspebble. A throng of evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversedlife and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirelyvisible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.Do you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here isboffete, a box on the ear, which is derived from bofeton; vantane,window (later on vanterne), which comes from vantana; gat, cat, whichcomes from gato; acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. Do you wantItalian? Here is spade, sword, which comes from spada; carvel, boat,which comes from caravella. Do you want English? Here is bichot, whichcomes from bishop; raille, spy, which comes from rascal, rascalion;pilche, a case, which comes from pilcher, a sheath. Do you want German?Here is the caleur, the waiter, kellner; the hers, the master, herzog(duke). Do you want Latin? Here is frangir, to break, frangere; affurer,to steal, fur; cadene, chain, catena. There is one word which crops upin every language of the continent, with a sort of mysterious power andauthority. It is the word magnus; the Scotchman makes of it his mac,which designates the chief of the clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, thegreat Farlane, the great Callumore[41]; slang turns it into meck andlater le meg, that is to say, God. Would you like Basque? Here isgahisto, the devil, which comes from gaiztoa, evil; sorgabon, goodnight, which comes from gabon, good evening. Do you want Celtic? Here isblavin, a handkerchief, which comes from blavet, gushing water; menesse,a woman (in a bad sense), which comes from meinec, full of stones;barant, brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith, from goff,blacksmith; guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du, black-white.Finally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns les malteses, asouvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta.In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possessesother and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from themind of man itself.In the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies themystery of tongues. To paint with words, which contains figuresone knows not how or why, is the primitive foundation of all humanlanguages, what may be called their granite.Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, wordscreated instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, withoutetymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous,sometimes hideous words, which at times possess a singular power ofexpression and which live. The executioner, le taule; the forest,le sabri; fear, flight, taf; the lackey, le larbin; the mineral,the prefect, the minister, pharos; the devil, le rabouin. Nothing isstranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some, le rabouin,for example, are at the same time grotesque and terrible, and produce onyou the effect of a cyclopean grimace.In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which isdesirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures.Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke,the prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom is moremetaphorical than slang: devisser le coco (to unscrew the nut), to twistthe neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat; etre gerbe, to be tried; arat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains, a striking, ancient figurewhich partly bears its date about it, which assimilates long obliquelines of rain, with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers, andwhich compresses into a single word the popular expression: it rainshalberds. Sometimes, in proportion as slang progresses from the firstepoch to the second, words pass from the primitive and savage sense tothe metaphorical sense. The devil ceases to be le rabouin, and becomesle boulanger (the baker), who puts the bread into the oven. This ismore witty, but less grand, something like Racine after Corneille, likeEuripides after AEschylus. Certain slang phrases which participatein the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and themetaphorical character resemble phantasmagories. Les sorgueuers vontsolliciter des gails a la lune--the prowlers are going to steal horsesby night,--this passes before the mind like a group of spectres. Oneknows not what one sees.In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It usesit in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and itoften confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross andsummary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed andcomplicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, inwhich there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, thedirect creation and the metaphor: le cab jaspine, je marronne que laroulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, the dog is barking, I suspectthat the diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. Le dab estsinve, la dabuge est merloussiere, la fee est bative, the bourgeois isstupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally,to throw listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding toall the words of the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, atermination in aille, in orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Vousierguetrouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of muttongood? A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find outwhether the sum offered for his escape suited him.The termination in mar has been added recently.Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupteditself. Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon asit feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to whathappens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which fallsupon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process ofdecomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which neverpauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in tencenturies. Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail (horse)becomes le gaye; la fertanche (straw) becomes la fertille; le momignard(brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds), frusques; la chique (thechurch), l'egrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas. The devil is atfirst, gahisto, then le rabouin, then the baker; the priest is aratichon, then the boar (le sanglier); the dagger is le vingt-deux(twenty-two), then le surin, then le lingre; the police are railles,then roussins, then rousses, then marchands de lacets (dealers instay-laces), then coquers, then cognes; the executioner is le taule,then Charlot, l'atigeur, then le becquillard. In the seventeenthcentury, to fight was "to give each other snuff"; in the nineteenthit is "to chew each other's throats." There have been twenty differentphrases between these two extremes. Cartouche's talk would have beenHebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of this language are perpetuallyengaged in flight like the men who utter them.Still, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement,the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has itsheadquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the slangof the seventeenth century; Bicetre, when it was a prison, preserved theslang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in anche ofthe old Thuneurs. Boyanches-tu (bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetualmovement remains its law, nevertheless.If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes ofobservation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, he fallsinto doleful and useful meditation. No study is more efficacious andmore fecund in instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, inslang, which does not contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat meansto feign; one beats a malady; ruse is their strength.For them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea ofdarkness. The night is called la sorgue; man, l'orgue. Man is aderivative of the night.They have taken up the practice of considering society in the lightof an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they speak oftheir liberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is asick man; one who is condemned is a dead man.The most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in whichhe is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls the dungeonthe castus. In that funereal place, life outside always presents itselfunder its most smiling aspect. The prisoner has irons on his feet; youthink, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet that onewalks? No; he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances; so,when he has succeeded in severing his fetters, his first idea is thatnow he can dance, and he calls the saw the bastringue (public-houseball).--A name is a centre; profound assimilation.--The ruffian has twoheads, one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his lifelong, and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of hisdeath; he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne,and the head which expiates it la tronche.--When a man has no longeranything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart, when he hasarrived at that double moral and material degradation which the wordblackguard characterizes in its two acceptations, he is ripe for crime;he is like a well-whetted knife; he has two cutting edges, hisdistress and his malice; so slang does not say a blackguard, it saysun reguise.--What are the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. Theconvict calls himself a fagot.--And finally, what name do malefactorsgive to their prison? The college. A whole penitentiary system can beevolved from that word.Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of thegalleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, havehad their birth?Let him listen to what follows:--There existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large and long cellar. Thiscellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neitherwindows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enterthere, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, andfor floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rottedand cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor,a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from sideto side; from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains threefeet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings for theneck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys wereincarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They werethrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in thedarkness and waiting for him.The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,caught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted andleft there. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. Theyremained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam,almost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug,or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to theirvery calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and knees givingway, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain somerest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened everymoment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In order toeat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, alongtheir leg with their heel until it reached their hand.How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six monthssometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys.Men were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In thissepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, theywent through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, theysang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the watersof Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard beforethe sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gonethrough the prison-cellar of the Chatelet, said: "It was the rhymes thatkept me up." Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth.It is from the dungeon of the Grand-Chatelet of Paris that comesthe melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: "Timaloumisaine,timaloumison." The majority of these:       Icicaille est la theatre        Here is the theatre       Du petit dardant.               Of the little archer (Cupid).Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heartof man, love.In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret isthe thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches,is unity which serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is totear from each member of this fierce community something of his ownpersonality. To inform against, in the energetic slang dialect, iscalled: "to eat the bit." As though the informer drew to himself alittle of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of eachone's flesh.What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphorreplies: "It is to see thirty-six candles."Here slang intervenes and takes it up: Candle, camoufle. Thereupon, theordinary tongue gives camouflet[42] as the synonym for soufflet. Thus,by a sort of infiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor,that incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to theAcademy; and Poulailler saying: "I light my camoufle," causes Voltaireto write: "Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets."Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study andinvestigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point ofintersection of regular society with society which is accursed.The thief also has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I,whoever passes by; le pantre. (Pan, everybody.)Slang is language turned convict.That the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that itcan be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality,that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss, issufficient to create consternation.Oh, poor thought of miserable wretches!Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness?Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator, theimmense rider of Pegasi and hippo-griffs, the combatant of heroes ofthe dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, the radiantknight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain to her assistancethe lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned to hear the fearfulapproach of Evil through the density of the gulf, and to catch glimpses,nearer and nearer at hand, beneath the hideous water of that dragon'shead, that maw streaked with foam, and that writhing undulation ofclaws, swellings, and rings? Must it remain there, without a gleamof light, without hope, given over to that terrible approach, vaguelyscented out by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms,forever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white and nakedamid the shadows!CHAPTER III--SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHSAs the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundredyears ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful,now menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of thosevagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs oftheir own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, forinstance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves,a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot of thistree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting a huntsmanon a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot, whenceemerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than thesereprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakesfor the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling ofcounterfeiters. The diverse forms assumed by thought in the realmof slang, even song, even raillery, even menace, all partook of thispowerless and dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of someof which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the point ofevoking tears. The pegre is always the poor pegre, and he is alwaysthe hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardlycomplains, he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans has comedown to us: "I do not understand how God, the father of men, can torturehis children and his grandchildren and hear them cry, without himselfsuffering torture."[43] The wretch, whenever he has time to think, makeshimself small before the low, and frail in the presence of society;he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to the side ofcompassion; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt.Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison songsand thieves' ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and jovialmien. The plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla. We find in theeighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons,a diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident and liltingrefrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescentgleam, and which seems to have been flung into the forest by awill-o'-the-wisp playing the fife:--                    Miralabi suslababo                    Mirliton ribonribette                    Surlababi mirlababo                    Mirliton ribonribo.This was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting aman's throat.A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy ofthe dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the grandmeg and the grand dab. Given Louis XV. they call the King of France "leMarquis de Pantin." And behold, they are almost gay. A sort of gleamproceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their consciences werenot heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes of darkness haveno longer merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess theheedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense oftheir criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers,some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of. Asign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines andsophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, whilecommunicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, ofsome outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shallarise.Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenthcentury? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenthcentury is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderotat their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers,Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,--these arefour sacred legions. Humanity's immense advance towards the light is dueto them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towardsthe four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards the beautiful,Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau towardsthe just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, there were thesophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth, hemlockin the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the greatbooks of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of thecourt-house, writers now forgotten were publishing, with the King'ssanction, no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings, which wereeagerly read by the unfortunate. Some of these publications, odd tosay, which were patronized by a prince, are to be found in the SecretLibrary. These facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on thesurface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger.It is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the onewho probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery wasRestif de La Bretonne.This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages inGermany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed upby Schiller in his famous drama The Robbers, theft and pillage rose upin protest against property and labor, assimilated certain specious andfalse elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance, were absurd inreality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them,after a fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state oftheory, and in that shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, andhonest masses, unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had preparedthe mixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a factof this sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenderswrath; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep,which is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of theunfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-madespirit which dreams in a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny ofsociety. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing.Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearfulcommotions which were formerly called jacqueries, beside which purelypolitical agitations are the merest child's play, which are no longerthe conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt ofdiscomfort against comfort. Then everything crumbles.Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people.It is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenthcentury, which the French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cutshort.The French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed withthe sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed thedoor of ill and opened the door of good.It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma,rendered the century healthy, crowned the populace.It may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving him asecond soul, the right.The nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work, andto-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simplyimpossible. Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he who fears it!Revolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie.Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. Feudal andmonarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. There is no more ofthe Middle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the days whenterrible swarms within made irruptions, when one heard beneath his feetthe obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations frommole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where thesoil cracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where onesuddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth.The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, oncedeveloped, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all isliberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, according toRobespierre's admirable definition. Since '89, the whole people hasbeen dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man, who,possessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feelswithin him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is aninternal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; he who votes reigns. Henceincorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence eyesheroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary wholesomenessis such, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August,there is no longer any populace. The first cry of the enlightened andincreasing throngs is: death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; theideal and the absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom werethe wagons containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? Bythe rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard overthe treasure. Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. Inthose wagons in chests, hardly closed, and some, even, half-open, amid ahundred dazzling caskets, was that ancient crown of France, studded withdiamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty, by the Regent diamond,which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted, they guarded that crown.Hence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of the skilful. Theold fear has produced its last effects in that quarter; and henceforthit can no longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of thered spectre is broken. Every one knows it now. The scare-crow scaresno longer. The birds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creaturesalight upon it, the bourgeois laugh at it.CHAPTER IV--THE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO HOPEThis being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not.There is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; bloodwill no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the mannerin which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisisis there. Social phthisis is called misery.One can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck bylightning.Let us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forgetthat this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts mustunderstand that the first of political necessities consists in thinkingfirst of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in solacing,airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon to amagnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every form, inoffering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness,in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of theuniversal aim, in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limitto wealth, in creating vast fields of public and popular activity, inhaving, like Briareus, a hundred hands to extend in all directions tothe oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective power for thatgrand duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes,and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmentingsalaries, diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is,that is to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need;in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light and morecomfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant.And, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question isthis: labor cannot be a law without being a right.We will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place forthat.If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight.Intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than materialimprovement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity,truth is nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from scienceand wisdom grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against stomachs andminds which do not eat. If there is anything more heart-breaking thana body perishing for lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying fromhunger for the light.The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day weshall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emergenaturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery will beaccomplished by a simple elevation of level.We should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation.The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures.This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking andadvancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. He arriveswith his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with hisbanner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, hethreatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on ourside. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped.What have we to fear, we who believe?No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there existsa return of a river on its course.But let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. Whenthey say "no" to progress, it is not the future but themselves thatthey are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they areinoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejectingTo-morrow, and that is to die.Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soulnever,--this is what we desire.Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problemwill be solved.Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will befinished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The futureblossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is adivinely fatal phenomenon.Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct themwithin a given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a state ofequilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth andheaven results from humanity and governs it; this force is a workerof miracles; marvellous issues are no more difficult to it thanextraordinary vicissitudes. Aided by science, which comes from one man,and by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmedby these contradictions in the attitude of problems, which seemimpossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing asolution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a lessonfrom the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from thatmysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occidentface to face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made theimaums converse with Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid.In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in thegrandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists essentiallyin science and peace. Its object is, and its result must be, to dissolvewrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinizes, itanalyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds by means ofreduction, discarding all hatred.More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the windwhich is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks ofnations and empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,--and some fineday that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them allaway. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, ofEgypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What arethe causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societieshave been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vicewhich destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these terribledeaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no reply.Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then theysank. We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror thatwe look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behindthose colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels,Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts whichemerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But shadows are there, andlight is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancientcivilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own. Everywhereupon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its beauties, welay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness oncediagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy.Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and itsprodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It isalready much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point.All the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towardsthis point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty--to auscultatecivilization.We repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by thispersistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, anaustere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, wefeel human imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it hasthese wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, norbecause of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people donot kill man.And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes hishead at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have theirhours of weakness.Will the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost putthis question, when we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholyface-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part ofthe selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetiteincreasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity which dulls,a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for thesuffering, an implacable satisfaction, the I so swollen that it bars thesoul; on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeingothers enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuagingits desires, hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure andsimple ignorance.Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous pointwhich we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The idealis frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated,imperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces,monstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in themaw of the clouds.BOOK EIGHTH.--ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONSCHAPTER I--FULL LIGHTThe reader has probably understood that Eponine, having recognizedthrough the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon hadsent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet,and had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spentin ecstasy before that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which drawsthe iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is builtthe house of her whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette's garden asRomeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for himthan for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had onlyto use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate whichvacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people's teeth.Marius was slender and readily passed through.As there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never enteredthe garden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.Beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed thesetwo souls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period ofher existence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the leastunscrupulous or debauched, she would have been lost; for there aregenerous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them.One of woman's magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where itis absolute, is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindnessof modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give theheart, and we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze uponit in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle course; it eitherruins or it saves. All human destiny lies in this dilemma. This dilemma,ruin, or safety, is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality thanby love. Love is life, if it is not death. Cradle; also coffin. The samesentiment says "yes" and "no" in the human heart. Of all the things thatGod has made, the human heart is the one which sheds the most light,alas! and the most darkness.God willed that Cosette's love should encounter one of the loves whichsave.Throughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there werethere, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath thatthicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day, two beingscomposed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with all thefelicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure,honest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the shadows.It seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, and to Marius that Cosettehad a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each other, theyclasped each other's hands, they pressed close to each other; but therewas a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected it;they did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier,Cosette's innocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius' loyalty. Thefirst kiss had also been the last. Marius, since that time, had not gonefurther than to touch Cosette's hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of herhair, with his lips. For him, Cosette was a perfume and not a woman.He inhaled her. She refused nothing, and he asked nothing. Cosette washappy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived in this ecstatic state whichcan be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul. It wasthe ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal. Two swansmeeting on the Jungfrau.At that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute,beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphicMarius, would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raisedCosette's robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight,Cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fellapart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Mariusturned away his eyes.What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored eachother.At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a sacredspot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and theyopened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton andvigorous vegetation quivered, full of strength and intoxication, aroundthese two innocents, and they uttered words of love which set the treesto trembling.What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed totrouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which weshould find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book theseconversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smokewreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of twolovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompaniesthem like a lyre, and what remains is nothing more than a shade; yousay: "What! is that all!" eh! yes, childish prattle, repetitions,laughter at nothing, nonsense, everything that is deepest and mostsublime in the world! The only things which are worth the trouble ofsaying and hearing!The man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered theseabsurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a maliciousfellow. Cosette said to Marius:--"Dost thou know?--"[In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without eitherof them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun to calleach other thou.]"Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie.""Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette.""Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I wasa little thing. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like thatname--Euphrasie?""Yes. But Cosette is not ugly.""Do you like it better than Euphrasie?""Why, yes.""Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call meCosette."And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of agrove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at himand exclaimed:--"Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, youare not at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bidyou defiance with this word: I love you!"And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by astar.Or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, and she said tohim:--"Don't cough, sir; I will not have people cough on my domain without mypermission. It's very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I want you tobe well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should bevery unhappy. What should I do then?"And this was simply divine.Once Marius said to Cosette:--"Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule."This made both of them laugh the whole evening.In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:--"Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breakingup a veteran!" But he stopped short, and went no further. He would havebeen obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was impossible.This bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which that immenseand innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright.Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without anythingelse; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old andaccommodating bar of the chief-justice's gate, to sit elbow to elbowon that bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of theon-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into theample fall of Cosette's gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call herthou, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever,indefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Everytime that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men thanof the clouds of heaven.This chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means.To pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method ofbestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A complimentis something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles therewith its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws backbefore voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius' blandishments, allsaturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds whenthey fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear suchwords. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, allthe positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said inthe bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyricaleffusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles ofcooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet andexhaling a celestial perfume, an ineffable twitter of heart to heart."Oh!" murmured Marius, "how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you.It is all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I knownot what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip ofyour shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchantedgleam when you open your thought even but a little! You talkastonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times that you are adream. Speak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and howcharming! I am really beside myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. Istudy your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope."And Cosette answered:--"I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed sincethis morning."Questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, whichalways turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figuresalways turn on their peg.Cosette's whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency,whiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette that shewas clear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of Apriland dawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of theauroral light in the form of a woman.It was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her.But the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,talked with exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts oftrue and delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never madea mistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels andspeaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.No one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, atonce, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole ofwoman; in them lies the whole of heaven.In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. Acrushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthornbroken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled withmelancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. The mostsovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almostunbearable.And, in addition to this,--all these contradictions are the lightningplay of love,--they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and witha delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented theair of two boys.Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature isalways present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutaland sublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls, onefeels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysteriousshade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends.They idolized each other.The permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile,they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, theyinterlace their fingers, they call each other thou, and that does notprevent eternity.Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in theinvisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other inthe darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, theymurmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of theplanets fill the infinite universe.CHAPTER II--THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESSThey existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not noticethe cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. Theyhad confided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extendedmuch further than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was anorphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, thathe lived by writing things for publishers, that his father had been acolonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was onbad terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at beinga baron, but this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did notknow the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, shehad confided to him that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpusconvent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that her father's namewas M. Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great dealto the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himselfeverything though he denied her nothing.Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since hehad been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recentpast, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette toldhim satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell herabout the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier, about theburn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did noteven know that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he hadbreakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears whichrendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hourswhen he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite naturalthat he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burdenof immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are calledlovers.Alas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does therecome an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go onafterwards?Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardentforgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will.There is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than thereis a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosetteand Marius nothing existed except Marius and Cosette. The universearound them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a golden minute. Therewas nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred to Mariusthat Cosette had a father. His brain was dazzled and obliterated. Ofwhat did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the flowers, andthe swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all sorts ofimportant things. They had told each other everything except everything.The everything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, thatlair, the ruffians, that adventure, to what purpose? And was he verysure that this nightmare had actually existed? They were two, and theyadored each other, and beyond that there was nothing. Nothing elseexisted. It is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear isinherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are thereany? Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer know. A rosy cloudhangs over it.So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all thatimprobability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at thezenith, between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, inthe clouds; hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot;already too sublime to walk the earth, still too heavily charged withhumanity to disappear in the blue, suspended like atoms which arewaiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny;ignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; amazed, rapturous,floating, soaring; at times so light that they could take their flightout into the infinite; almost prepared to soar away to all eternity.They slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of thereal overwhelmed by the ideal.Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in herpresence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.Marius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them.They considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange claim onman's part to wish that love should lead to something.CHAPTER III--THE BEGINNING OF SHADOWJean Valjean suspected nothing.Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and thatsufficed for Jean Valjean's happiness. The thoughts which Cosettecherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius' image which filled herheart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears herlove as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, whentwo lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; thethird party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfectblindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always thesame in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any ofJean Valjean's proposals. Did she want to take a walk? "Yes, dear littlefather." Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to passthe evening with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed atten o'clock, Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions untilafter that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the longglass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in thedaytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was inexistence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette: "Why,you have whitewash on your back!" On the previous evening, Marius, in atransport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, andwas as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hidthemselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neitherbe seen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequentlycontenting themselves, by way of conversation, with pressing eachother's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of thetrees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces fromthem, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the revery ofthe one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other.Limpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of loveis a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.The whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Everytime that Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of thegate in such a manner that no displacement was visible.He usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac'slodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:--"Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o'clock in themorning."Bahorel replied:--"What do you expect? There's always a petard in a seminary fellow."At times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said toMarius:--"You are getting irregular in your habits, young man."Courfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part thisreflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in thehabit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then hecalled upon Marius to come back to reality.One morning, he threw him this admonition:--"My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located inthe moon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,soap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what's her name?"But nothing could induce Marius "to talk." They might have torn out hisnails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffablename, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and assilent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that histaciturnity was of the beaming order.During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know theseimmense delights. To dispute and to say you for thou, simply that theymight say thou the better afterwards. To talk at great length with veryminute details, of persons in whom they took not the slightest interestin the world; another proof that in that ravishing opera called love,the libretto counts for almost nothing.For Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery.For Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics;To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Ruede Babylone;To gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleamingin the grass;To hold their peace together; a still greater delight than conversation;Etc., etc.In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of theBoulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As hewas on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard someone quite close to him say:--"Good evening, Monsieur Marius."He raised his head and recognized Eponine.This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of thatgirl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the RuePlumet, he had not seen her again, and she had gone completely out ofhis mind. He had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, heowed her his happiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet her.It is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leadsman to a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, toa state of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, buthe also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, matters essential andimportant to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would havebehaved quite differently to Eponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had noteven clearly put it to himself that this Eponine was named EponineThenardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his father's will,that name, for which, but a few months before, he would have so ardentlysacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father himself wasfading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love.He replied with some embarrassment:--"Ah! so it's you, Eponine?""Why do you call me you? Have I done anything to you?""No," he answered.Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt thathe could not do otherwise, now that he used thou to Cosette, than sayyou to Eponine.As he remained silent, she exclaimed:--"Say--"Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature formerlyso heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not. Then sheresumed:--"Well?"Then she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes."Good evening, Mr. Marius," said she suddenly and abruptly; and away shewent.CHAPTER IV--A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANGThe following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessaryto indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung onthe horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius,at nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening,with the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sightof Eponine approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two daysin succession--this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted theboulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the RueMonsieur.This caused Eponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing whichshe had not yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself withwatching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking toencounter him. It was only on the evening before that she had attemptedto address him.So Eponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw himdisplace the bar and slip into the garden.She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, andreadily recognized the one which Marius had moved.She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:--"None of that, Lisette!"She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside thebar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point wherethe railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, inwhich Eponine was entirely concealed.She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and withoutbreathing, a prey to her thoughts.Towards ten o'clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons whopassed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was makinghaste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirtedthe garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall,heard a dull and threatening voice saying:--"I'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening."The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer intothe black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later,six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from eachother, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,entered the Rue Plumet.The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for theothers; a second later, all six were reunited.These men began to talk in a low voice."This is the place," said one of them."Is there a cab [dog] in the garden?" asked another."I don't know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we'll make himeat.""Have you some putty to break the pane with?""Yes.""The railing is old," interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of aventriloquist."So much the better," said the second who had spoken. "It won't screechunder the saw, and it won't be hard to cut."The sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspectthe gate, as Eponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar insuccession, and shaking them cautiously.Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on thepoint of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness,fell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a pushin the middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but notloudly:--"There's a dog."At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. Hebristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold asferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.He recoiled and stammered:--"What jade is this?""Your daughter."It was, in fact, Eponine, who had addressed Thenardier.At the apparition of Eponine, the other five, that is to say,Claquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselesslydrawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with thesinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night.Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands.Guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers callfanchons."Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Areyou crazy?" exclaimed Thenardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and stillspeak low; "what have you come here to hinder our work for?"Eponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck."I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn't a person allowed tosit on the stones nowadays? It's you who ought not to be here. Whathave you come here for, since it's a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There'snothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It's along time since I've seen you! So you're out?"Thenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponine's arms, andgrumbled:--"That's good. You've embraced me. Yes, I'm out. I'm not in. Now, getaway with you."But Eponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses."But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever toget out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tellme about mamma."Thenardier replied:--"She's well. I don't know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.""I won't go, so there now," pouted Eponine like a spoiled child; "yousend me off, and it's four months since I saw you, and I've hardly hadtime to kiss you."And she caught her father round the neck again."Come, now, this is stupid!" said Babet."Make haste!" said Guelemer, "the cops may pass."The ventriloquist's voice repeated his distich:--     "Nous n' sommes pas le jour de l'an,                              "This isn't New Year's day     A becoter papa, maman."                               To peck at pa and ma."Eponine turned to the five ruffians."Why, it's Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day,Monsieur Claquesous. Don't you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it,Montparnasse?""Yes, they know you!" ejaculated Thenardier. "But good day, goodevening, sheer off! leave us alone!""It's the hour for foxes, not for chickens," said Montparnasse."You see the job we have on hand here," added Babet.Eponine caught Montparnasse's hand."Take care," said he, "you'll cut yourself, I've a knife open.""My little Montparnasse," responded Eponine very gently, "you must haveconfidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. MonsieurBabet, Monsieur Guelemer, I'm the person who was charged to investigatethis matter."It is remarkable that Eponine did not talk slang. That frightful tonguehad become impossible to her since she had known Marius.She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton,Guelemer's huge, coarse fingers, and continued:--"You know well that I'm no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I haverendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries;you will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you thatthere is nothing in this house.""There are lone women," said Guelemer."No, the persons have moved away.""The candles haven't, anyway!" ejaculated Babet.And he pointed out to Eponine, across the tops of the trees, a lightwhich was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It wasToussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.Eponine made a final effort."Well," said she, "they're very poor folks, and it's a hovel where thereisn't a sou.""Go to the devil!" cried Thenardier. "When we've turned the house upsidedown and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we'll tellyou what there is inside, and whether it's francs or sous orhalf-farthings."And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering."My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse," said Eponine, "I entreat you, youare a good fellow, don't enter.""Take care, you'll cut yourself," replied Montparnasse.Thenardier resumed in his decided tone:--"Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!"Eponine released Montparnasse's hand, which she had grasped again, andsaid:--"So you mean to enter this house?""Rather!" grinned the ventriloquist.Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who werearmed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons,and said in a firm, low voice:--"Well, I don't mean that you shall."They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin.She went on:--"Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I'm talking. Inthe first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on thisgate, I'll scream, I'll beat on the door, I'll rouse everybody, I'llhave the whole six of you seized, I'll call the police.""She'd do it, too," said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon and theventriloquist.She shook her head and added:--"Beginning with my father!"Thenardier stepped nearer."Not so close, my good man!" said she.He retreated, growling between his teeth:--"Why, what's the matter with her?"And he added:--"Bitch!"She began to laugh in a terrible way:--"As you like, but you shall not enter here. I'm not the daughter ofa dog, since I'm the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, whatmatters that to me? You are men. Well, I'm a woman. You don't frightenme. I tell you that you shan't enter this house, because it doesn't suitme. If you approach, I'll bark. I told you, I'm the dog, and I don'tcare a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, butdon't come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I'll use kicks;it's all the same to me, come on!"She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst outlaughing:--"Pardine! I'm not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall becold this winter. Aren't they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to thinkthey can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you havefinical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on abig voice, forsooth! I ain't afraid of anything, that I ain't!"She fastened her intent gaze upon Thenardier and said:--"Not even of you, father!"Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes uponthe ruffians in turn:--"What do I care if I'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement ofthe Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father's club, or whether I'mfound a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans inthe midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?"She was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath camefrom her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.She resumed:--"I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang!There are six of you; I represent the whole world."Thenardier made a movement towards her."Don't approach!" she cried.He halted, and said gently:--"Well, no; I won't approach, but don't speak so loud. So you intend tohinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all thesame. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?""You bother me," said Eponine."But we must live, we must eat--""Burst!"So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence andhummed:--       "Mon bras si dodu,            "My arm so plump,        Ma jambe bien faite           My leg well formed,        Et le temps perdu."           And time wasted."She had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and sheswung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitteda view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lanternilluminated her profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and moresurprising could be seen.The six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl,retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel withfurious and humiliated shrugs.In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air."There's something the matter with her," said Babet. "A reason. Is shein love with the dog? It's a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, anold fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain't so badat the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job's a goodone.""Well, go in, then, the rest of you," exclaimed Montparnasse. "Do thejob. I'll stay here with the girl, and if she fails us--"He flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light ofthe lantern.Thenardier said not a word, and seemed ready for whatever the restpleased.Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader knows,"put up the job," had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful. He hadthe reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known that hehad plundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this he madeverses and songs, which gave him great authority.Babet interrogated him:--"You say nothing, Brujon?"Brujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head invarious ways, and finally concluded to speak:--"See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, thisevening I jostled a woman who was quarrelling. All that's bad. Let'squit."They went away.As they went, Montparnasse muttered:--"Never mind! if they had wanted, I'd have cut her throat."Babet responded"I wouldn't. I don't hit a lady."At the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the followingenigmatical dialogue in a low tone:--"Where shall we go to sleep to-night?""Under Pantin [Paris].""Have you the key to the gate, Thenardier?""Pardi."Eponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat by theroad by which they had come. She rose and began to creep after themalong the walls and the houses. She followed them thus as far as theboulevard.There they parted, and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom,where they appeared to melt away.CHAPTER V--THINGS OF THE NIGHTAfter the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed itstranquil, nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in thisstreet would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist ina sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of suddenapparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes,through the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which weliving beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night. Nature,bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which shefancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom knoweach other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and clawsfear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voraciousappetites, hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nailsand jaws which have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell outuneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, erectin its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them to live witha dead and terrible life. These brutalities, which are only matter,entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscuritycondensed into an unknown being. A black figure barring the way stopsthe wild beast short. That which emerges from the cemetery intimidatesand disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the ferocious fear thesinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.CHAPTER VI--MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVINGCOSETTE HIS ADDRESSWhile this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over thegate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was byCosette's side.Never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, thetrees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never hadthe birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never hadall the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to theinward music of love; never had Marius been more captivated, more happy,more ecstatic.But he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes werered.This was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.Marius' first word had been: "What is the matter?"And she had replied: "This."Then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while hetremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:--"My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because hehas business, and we may go away from here."Marius shivered from head to foot.When one is at the end of one's life, to die means to go away; when oneis at the beginning of it, to go away means to die.For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees,taken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, inthe case of first love, the soul is taken long before the body; lateron, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one does not takethe soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add: "Because there isnone"; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessedCosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her with all his soul, andseized her jealously with incredible conviction. He possessed her smile,her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, thesweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark whichshe had on her neck, all her thoughts. Therefore, he possessed allCosette's dreams.He incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with hisbreath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared tohimself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belongto him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore, herknot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her cuffs, as sacredobjects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord ofthose pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair, and he even said tohimself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness whichdid not make their way to the light, that there was not a ribbon of hergown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold in her bodice, which wasnot his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property, hisown thing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though they hadso intermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tellthem apart had they wished to take them back again.--"This is mine.""No, it is mine." "I assure you that you are mistaken. This is myproperty." "What you are taking as your own is myself."--Marius wassomething that made a part of Cosette, and Cosette was something whichmade a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within him. To have Cosette,to possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be distinguished frombreathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of this intoxication, ofthis virgin possession, unprecedented and absolute, of this sovereignty,that these words: "We are going away," fell suddenly, at a blow, andthat the harsh voice of reality cried to him: "Cosette is not yours!"Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said,outside of life; those words, going away! caused him to re-enter itharshly.He found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was verycold. She said to him in her turn: "What is the matter?"He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:--"I did not understand what you said."She began again:--"This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and tohold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in atrunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away,that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one forhim, and that all is to be ready in a week from now, and that we mightgo to England.""But this is outrageous!" exclaimed Marius.It is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence, notone of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, ofTiberius, or of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity,in the opinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off toEngland because he had business there.He demanded in a weak voice:--"And when do you start?""He did not say when.""And when shall you return?""He did not say when."Marius rose and said coldly:--"Cosette, shall you go?"Cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish,and replied in a sort of bewilderment:--"Where?""To England. Shall you go?""Why do you say you to me?""I ask you whether you will go?""What do you expect me to do?" she said, clasping her hands."So, you will go?""If my father goes.""So, you will go?"Cosette took Marius' hand, and pressed it without replying."Very well," said Marius, "then I will go elsewhere."Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words.She turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom. Shestammered:--"What do you mean?"Marius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered:"Nothing."When his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. The smile of awoman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, even at night."How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea.""What is it?""If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join mewherever I am."Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into reality.He cried to Cosette:--"Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and Ihave none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don't know howmuch, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom youare not acquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three francs,I have a coat which lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all ragged, myelbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six weeks Ihave not thought about it, and I have not told you about it. You onlysee me at night, and you give me your love; if you were to see me in thedaytime, you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I haven't enough topay for a passport!"He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his browpressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed hisskin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there hestood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of despair.He remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in suchabysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stiflednoise, which was sweet yet sad.It was Cosette sobbing.She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as hemeditated.He came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, hetook the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, andkissed it.She let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a womanaccepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love."Do not weep," he said.She murmured:--"Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!"He went on:--"Do you love me?"She replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never morecharming than amid tears:--"I adore you!"He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:--"Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?""Do you love me?" said she.He took her hand."Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because myword of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well, Igive you my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall die."In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy sosolemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill whichis produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock madeher cease weeping."Now, listen," said he, "do not expect me to-morrow.""Why?""Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow.""Oh! Why?""You will see.""A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!""Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps."And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside:--"He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received anyone except in the evening.""Of what man are you speaking?" asked Cosette."I? I said nothing.""What do you hope, then?""Wait until the day after to-morrow.""You wish it?""Yes, Cosette."She took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in orderto be on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.Marius resumed:--"Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something mighthappen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Ruede la Verrerie, No. 16."He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the bladehe wrote on the plaster of the wall:--"16 Rue de la Verrerie."In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more."Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh!tell me, so that I may pass a pleasant night.""This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part us.Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow.""What shall I do until then?" said Cosette. "You are outside, you go,and come! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sadI shall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tellme.""I am going to try something.""Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you maybe successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it.You are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing thatmusic from Euryanthe that you love, and that you came one evening tolisten to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you will comeearly. I shall expect you at dusk, at nine o'clock precisely, I warnyou. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke ofnine, do you understand, I shall be in the garden.""And I also."And without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled bythose electric currents which place lovers in continual communication,both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell intoeach other's arms, without perceiving that their lips met while theiruplifted eyes, overflowing with rapture and full of tears, gazed uponthe stars.When Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the momentwhen Eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, anidea had crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged to besenseless and impossible. He had come to a desperate decision.CHAPTER VII--THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACHOTHERAt that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-firstbirthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, asthe reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await deathperfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom evensorrow cannot curve.Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: "My father issinking." He no longer boxed the maids' ears; he no longer thumpedthe landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow inopening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for thespace of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, thatcoupling of words, in the Moniteur: M. Humblot-Conte, peer of France.The fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, hedid not yield; this was no more a characteristic of his physical thanof his moral nature, but he felt himself giving way internally. For fouryears he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly planted, thatis the exact word, in the conviction that that good-for-nothing youngscamp would ring at his door some day or other; now he had reachedthe point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself, thatif Marius made him wait much longer--It was not death that wasinsupportable to him; it was the idea that perhaps he should never seeMarius again. The idea of never seeing Marius again had never enteredhis brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to him, andit chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine and naturalsentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather's love for theungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during Decembernights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest ofthe son.M. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things, incapableof taking a single step, he--the grandfather, towards his grandson; "Iwould die rather," he said to himself. He did not consider himselfas the least to blame; but he thought of Marius only with profoundtenderness, and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who isabout to vanish in the dark.He began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness.M. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, for itwould have rendered him furious and ashamed, had never loved a mistressas he loved Marius.He had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so thatit should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, anold portrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy,a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazedincessantly at that portrait. One day, he happened to say, as he gazedupon it:--"I think the likeness is strong.""To my sister?" inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. "Yes, certainly.""The old man added:--"And to him also."Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almostclosed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:--"Father, are you as angry with him as ever?"She paused, not daring to proceed further."With whom?" he demanded."With that poor Marius."He raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on thetable, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:--"Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretchedscoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, andwicked man!"And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear thatstood in his eye.Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to sayto his daughter point-blank:--"I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention himto me."Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acutediagnosis: "My father never cared very much for my sister after herfolly. It is clear that he detests Marius.""After her folly" meant: "after she had married the colonel."However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, MademoiselleGillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, theofficer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Theodule, had not been asuccess. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo. A vacancyin the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Theodule, on hisside, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the taskof pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer shocked thegoodman. Lieutenant Theodule was gay, no doubt, but a chatter-box,frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter of bad company; hehad mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to say about them,it is true also; but he talked badly. All his good qualities had adefect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about thelove affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Ruede Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in hisuniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him downrightintolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter:"I've had enough of that Theodule. I haven't much taste for warriorsin time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I don't know but I preferslashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of blades inbattle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the scabbard onthe pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a bully andlacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your cuirass, is doublyridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holds equally alooffrom swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer nor afinnicky-hearted man. Keep your Theodule for yourself."It was in vain that his daughter said to him: "But he is yourgrandnephew, nevertheless,"--it turned out that M. Gillenormand, whowas a grandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least agrand-uncle.In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Theodulehad only served to make him regret Marius all the more.One evening,--it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent FatherGillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,--he had dismissed hisdaughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone inhis chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on theandirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, withits nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned twocandles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and inhis hand a book which he was not reading. He was dressed, accordingto his wont, like an incroyable, and resembled an antique portrait byGarat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had nothis daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop'swadded cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore adressing gown, except when he rose and retired. "It gives one a look ofage," said he.Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and,as usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured alwaysended by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the pointwhere a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends hisheart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reasonwhy Marius should return, that if he intended to return, he shouldhave done it long ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was trying toaccustom himself to the thought that all was over, and that he shoulddie without having beheld "that gentleman" again. But his whole naturerevolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this. "Well!" saidhe,--this was his doleful refrain,--"he will not return!" His bald headhad fallen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gazeupon the ashes on his hearth.In the very midst of his revery, his old servant Basque entered, andinquired:--"Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?"The old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises underthe influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to hisheart. He stammered:--"M. Marius what?""I don't know," replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenanceby his master's air; "I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said tome: 'There's a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.'"Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:--"Show him in."And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyesfixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It wasMarius.Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.His almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused bythe shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely sadface.It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazementand joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in thepresence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; he sawMarius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it certainly wasMarius.At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so tospeak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished,well-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. Hefelt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward;his heart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and overflowedhis breast; at length all his tenderness came to the light and reachedhis lips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very foundation ofhis nature, what came forth was harshness. He said abruptly:--"What have you come here for?"Marius replied with embarrassment:--"Monsieur--"M. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into hisarms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was consciousthat he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodmanunendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlornwithin, and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness returned. Heinterrupted Marius in a peevish tone:--"Then why did you come?"That "then" signified: If you do not come to embrace me. Marius lookedat his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble."Monsieur--""Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?"He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that "the child"would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father that wasrequired of him; he dropped his eyes and replied:--"No, sir.""Then," exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that waspoignant and full of wrath, "what do you want of me?"Marius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble andtrembling voice:--"Sir, have pity on me."These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they wouldhave rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose;he supported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were white,his brow wavered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he bowed."Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man ofninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to theplay, to balls, to the cafe, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, youplease the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on mybrands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches thatare really such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity, isolation!You have your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright eyes, strength,appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair; I have no longer evenwhite hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my legs, I am losing mymemory; there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly,the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, thatis what I have come to; you have before you the whole future, full ofsunshine, and I am beginning to lose my sight, so far am I advancinginto the night; you are in love, that is a matter of course, I ambeloved by no one in all the world; and you ask pity of me! Parbleu!Moliere forgot that. If that is the way you jest at the courthouse,Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. You are droll."And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:--"Come, now, what do you want of me?""Sir," said Marius, "I know that my presence is displeasing to you, butI have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go awayimmediately.""You are a fool!" said the old man. "Who said that you were to go away?"This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom ofhis heart:--"Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!"M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, thathis harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was drivinghim away; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; andas his grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased hisharshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, and Marius didnot understand, which made the goodman furious.He began again:--"What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go noone knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it iseasily guessed, to lead a bachelor life; it's more convenient, to playthe dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given meno signs of life, you have contracted debts without even telling me topay them, you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and, atthe end of four years, you come to me, and that is all you have to sayto me!"This violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productiveonly of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms;a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophizedMarius bitterly:--"Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, yousay? Well, what? What is it? Speak!""Sir," said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is fallingover a precipice, "I have come to ask your permission to marry."M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way."Call my daughter."A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormanddid not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing, mute, withpendant arms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing backand forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said to her:--"Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes tomarry. That's all. Go away."The curt, hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange degreeof excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air, hardlyappeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable toescape her, and disappeared at her father's breath more swiftly than astraw before the hurricane.In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his backagainst the chimney-piece once more."You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have onlya permission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had arevolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got theupper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you not a Republican sinceyou are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic makes a goodsauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have youtaken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine,opposite the Rue des Nonamdieres, there is a cannon-ball incrusted inthe wall of the third story of a house with this inscription: 'July28th, 1830.' Go take a look at that. It produces a good effect. Ah!those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way, aren't theyerecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry?So you want to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without indiscretion?"He paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:--"Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earnat your trade of lawyer?""Nothing," said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that wasalmost fierce."Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundredlivres that I allow you?"Marius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:--"Then I understand the girl is rich?""As rich as I am.""What! No dowry?""No.""Expectations?""I think not.""Utterly naked! What's the father?""I don't know.""And what's her name?""Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.""Fauchewhat?""Fauchelevent.""Pttt!" ejaculated the old gentleman."Sir!" exclaimed Marius.M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speakingto himself:--"That's right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, twelvehundred livres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go andpurchase a couple of sous' worth of parsley from the fruiterer.""Sir," repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which wasvanishing, "I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, withclasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marryher!"The old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter,coughing and laughing at the same time."Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: 'Pardine! I'll go hunt up that oldblockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I'm not twenty-five!How I'd treat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I'd get alongwithout him! It's nothing to me, I'd say to him: "You're only too happyto see me, you old idiot, I want to marry, I desire to wed MamselleNo-matter-whom, daughter of Monsieur No-matter-what, I have no shoes,she has no chemise, that just suits; I want to throw my career, myfuture, my youth, my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge intowretchedness with a woman around my neck, that's an idea, and you mustconsent to it!" and the old fossil will consent.' Go, my lad, do asyou like, attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, yourCoupelevent--Never, sir, never!""Father--""Never!"At the tone in which that "never" was uttered, Marius lost all hope. Hetraversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering andmore like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure. M.Gillenormand followed him with his eyes, and at the moment when thedoor opened, and Marius was on the point of going out, he advanced fourpaces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen,seized Marius by the collar, brought him back energetically into theroom, flung him into an armchair and said to him:--"Tell me all about it!""It was that single word "father" which had effected this revolution.Marius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand's mobile face wasno longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature.The grandsire had given way before the grandfather."Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, tell meeverything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!""Father--" repeated Marius.The old man's entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance."Yes, that's right, call me father, and you'll see!"There was now something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and sopaternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition fromdiscouragement to hope, was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it were.He was seated near the table, the light from the candles brought outthe dilapidation of his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded withamazement."Well, father--" said Marius."Ah, by the way," interrupted M. Gillenormand, "you really have not apenny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket."He rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table:"Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.""Father," pursued Marius, "my good father, if you only knew! I love her.You cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg,she came there; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her, andthen, I don't know how it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! howunhappy that made me! Now, at last, I see her every day, at her ownhome, her father does not know it, just fancy, they are going away, itis in the garden that we meet, in the evening, her father means to takeher to England, then I said to myself: 'I'll go and see my grandfatherand tell him all about the affair. I should go mad first, I should die,I should fall ill, I should throw myself into the water. I absolutelymust marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.' This is the wholetruth, and I do not think that I have omitted anything. She lives in agarden with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhoodof the Invalides."Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance,beside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of hisvoice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. Atthe words "Rue Plumet" he interrupted his inhalation and allowed theremainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees."The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?--Let us see!--Are therenot barracks in that vicinity?--Why, yes, that's it. Your cousinTheodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gay girl,my good friend, a gay girl!--Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. It is whatused to be called the Rue Blomet.--It all comes back to me now. I haveheard of that little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In agarden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be a very tidycreature. Between ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has beencourting her a bit. I don't know where he did it. However, that's notto the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! Ithink it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It'sthe right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as aJacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! withtwenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will domyself the justice to say, that in the line of sans-culottes, I havenever loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce!There's no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives youwithout her father's knowledge. That's in the established order ofthings. I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More than one.Do you know what is done then? One does not take the matter ferociously;one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does not makeone's mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simplybehaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along,mortals; don't marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is agood-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louisin an old drawer; you say to him: 'See here, grandfather.' And thegrandfather says: 'That's a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, andold age must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my boy,you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles.Amuse yourself, deuce take it!' Nothing better! That's the way theaffair should be treated. You don't marry, but that does no harm. Youunderstand me?"Marius, petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign withhis head that he did not.The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap onthe knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air,and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:--"Booby! make her your mistress."Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfatherhad just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks,the lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing ofall that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The goodman was wandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in wordswhich Marius did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette.Those words, "make her your mistress," entered the heart of the strictyoung man like a sword.He rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to thedoor with a firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply tohis grandfather, raised his head erect again, and said:--"Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted mywife. I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell."Father Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended hisarms, tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closedonce more, and Marius had disappeared.The old man remained for several minutes motionless and as thoughstruck by lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as thougha clenched fist grasped his throat. At last he tore himself from hisarm-chair, ran, so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door,opened it, and cried:--"Help! Help!"His daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again,with a pitiful rattle: "Run after him! Bring him back! What have I doneto him? He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my God! This timehe will not come back!"He went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open withhis aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, while Basqueand Nicolette held him behind, and shouted:--"Marius! Marius! Marius! Marius!"But Marius could no longer hear him, for at that moment he was turningthe corner of the Rue Saint-Louis.The octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three timeswith an expression of anguish, recoiled tottering, and fell back into anarm-chair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, with quivering head and lipswhich moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his eyes and nothingany longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something whichresembled night.BOOK NINTH.--WHITHER ARE THEY GOING?CHAPTER I--JEAN VALJEANThat same day, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean wassitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in theChamp-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, orsimply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit whichgradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one, he nowrarely went out with Cosette. He had on his workman's waistcoat,and trousers of gray linen; and his long-visored cap concealed hiscountenance.He was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time,alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week ortwo, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walkingon the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thenardier; thanks to hisdisguise, Thenardier had not recognized him; but since that day, JeanValjean had seen him repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thenardierwas prowling about in their neighborhood.This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.Moreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented thisinconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in hislife, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, andthat while seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they mightvery readily discover a man like Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and goover to England.He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning overall sorts of thoughts in his mind,--Thenardier, the police, the journey,and the difficulty of procuring a passport.He was troubled from all these points of view.Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted hisattention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to hisstate of alarm.On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household wasstirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's shutterswere open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line,engraved, probably with a nail:--16 Rue de la Verrerie.This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar werewhite, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with thefine, fresh plaster.This had probably been written on the preceding night.What was this? A signal for others? A warning for himself?In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and thatstrangers had made their way into it.He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.His mind was now filling in this canvas.He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on thewall, for fear of alarming her.In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast bythe sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediatelybehind him.He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fellupon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head.He took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in largecharacters, with a pencil:--"MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE."Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope;he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than achild, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers ofdust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and whoslipped into the moat of the Champde-Mars.Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.CHAPTER II--MARIUSMarius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the housewith very little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart willunderstand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Theodule,had left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poetmight, apparently, expect some complications from this revelation madepoint-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama wouldgain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believesnothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believeseverything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youthhas none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous overCandide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius couldsooner have committed.He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer.He thought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At twoo'clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac's quarters and flunghimself, without undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shiningbrightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permitsideas to go and come in the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac,Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the room with their hatson and all ready to go out.Courfeyrac said to him:--"Are you coming to General Lamarque's funeral?"It seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.He went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols whichJavert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of February,and which had remained in his hands. These pistols were still loaded. Itwould be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when hetook them with him.All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; itrained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased apenny roll at a baker's, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appearsthat he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There aremoments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passingthrough one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; thisstep he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night withfeverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;--thiswas, that at nine o'clock he should see Cosette. This last happinessnow constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, ashe roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that heheard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his revery andsaid: "Is there fighting on hand?"At nightfall, at nine o'clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette,he was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgoteverything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he wasabout to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, andhe felt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which onelives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property, thatat the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosettewas not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversedthe thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: "Sheis waiting for me there," said he. Cosette was not there. He raised hiseyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made thetour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned tothe house, and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified,exasperated with grief and uneasiness, like a master who returns home atan evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked again,at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father's gloomy facemake its appearance, and demand: "What do you want?" This was nothing incomparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped,he lifted up his voice and called Cosette.--"Cosette!" he cried;"Cosette!" he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was over. Noone in the garden; no one in the house.Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was asblack and as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stoneseat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then heseated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with sweetnessand resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his thought, andhe said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there was leftfor him was to die.All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street,and which was calling to him through the trees:--"Mr. Marius!"He started to his feet."Hey?" said he."Mr. Marius, are you there?""Yes.""Mr. Marius," went on the voice, "your friends are waiting for you atthe barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie."This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse,rough voice of Eponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside themovable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one whoappeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into the gloom.CHAPTER III--M. MABEUFJean Valjean's purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in hisvenerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars;he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d'or. Hehad not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche.He had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter, asa lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants. Thepurse was actually lost. It is unnecessary to say that no one claimedit, and that it did not succor M. Mabeuf.Moreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course.His experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin desPlantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owedhis housekeeper's wages; now, as we have seen, he owed three quartersof his rent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his Flora after theexpiration of thirteen months. Some coppersmith had made stewpans ofthem. His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even theincomplete copies of his Flora which were in his possession, he haddisposed of the text, at a miserable price, as waste paper, to asecond-hand bookseller. Nothing now remained to him of his life's work.He set to work to eat up the money for these copies. When he saw thatthis wretched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his gardenand allowed it to run to waste. Before this, a long time before, he hadgiven up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from timeto time. He dined on bread and potatoes. He had sold the last of hisfurniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, his clothing and hisblankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he still retained his mostprecious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among others,Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible, edition of 1560; La Concordancedes Bibles, by Pierre de Besse; Les Marguerites de la Marguerite, ofJean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre; the book dela Charge et Dignite de l'Ambassadeur, by the Sieur de VilliersHotman; a Florilegium Rabbinicum of 1644; a Tibullus of 1567, with thismagnificent inscription: Venetiis, in aedibus Manutianis; and lastly, aDiogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained the famousvariant of the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican, andthose of the two manuscripts of Venice, 393 and 394, consulted withsuch fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all the passages in Doricdialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfthcentury belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any firein his chamber, and went to bed at sundown, in order not to consumeany candles. It seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors: peopleavoided him when he went out; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness ofa child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man interests ayoung girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is, ofall distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely losthis childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they restedon his books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius,which was a unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was theonly piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictlyindispensable.One day, Mother Plutarque said to him:--"I have no money to buy any dinner."What she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes."On credit?" suggested M. Mabeuf."You know well that people refuse me."M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, oneafter another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gazeupon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put itin under his arm and went out. He returned two hours later, withoutanything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:--"You will get something for dinner."From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which wasnever more lifted, descend over the old man's candid face.On the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, ithad to be done again.M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As thesecond-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchasedof him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs,sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole librarywent the same road. He said at times: "But I am eighty;" as though hecherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his daysbefore reaching the end of his books. His melancholy increased. Once,however, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a Robert Estienne,which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais, and hereturned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the Rue desGres.--"I owe five sous," he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That dayhe had no dinner.He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became knownthere. The president of the society came to see him, promised tospeak to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and didso.--"Why, what!" exclaimed the Minister, "I should think so! An oldsavant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for him!"On the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with theMinister. Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque."We are saved!" said he. On the day appointed, he went to the Minister'shouse. He perceived that his ragged cravat, his long, square coat, andhis waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to him, not even theMinister. About ten o'clock in the evening, while he was still waitingfor a word, he heard the Minister's wife, a beautiful woman in alow-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach, inquire: "Who isthat old gentleman?" He returned home on foot at midnight, in a drivingrain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to gothither.He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his DiogenesLaertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek toenjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no otherenjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell ill.There is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy breadat the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at theapothecary's. One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensivepotion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was required. M.Mabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last volume hadtaken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes Laertius.He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was the 4th ofJune, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal's successor,and returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-francpieces on the old serving-woman's nightstand, and returned to hischamber without saying a word.On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturnedpost in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,sitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyesvaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; theold man did not seem to perceive the fact.In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. Theyresembled shots and the clamors of a multitude.Father Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, andinquired:--"What is it?"The gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:--"It is the riots.""What riots?""Yes, they are fighting.""Why are they fighting?""Ah, good Heavens!" ejaculated the gardener."In what direction?" went on M. Mabeuf."In the neighborhood of the Arsenal."Father Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought for abook to place under his arm, found none, said: "Ah! truly!" and went offwith a bewildered air.BOOK TENTH.--THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832CHAPTER I--THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTIONOf what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of anelectricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly dartingforth, of a wandering force, of a passing breath. This breath encountersheads which speak, brains which dream, souls which suffer, passionswhich burn, wretchedness which howls, and bears them away.Whither?At random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and theinsolence of others.Irritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations,instincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which hasbeen exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change,the thirst for the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one totake pleasure in reading the posters for the new play, and love,the prompter's whistle, at the theatre; the vague hatreds, rancors,disappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankruptedit; discomfort, empty dreams, ambitious that are hedged about, whoeverhopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, therabble, that mud which catches fire,--such are the elements of revolt.That which is grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowloutside of all bounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants,vagabonds of the cross-roads, those who sleep at night in a desert ofhouses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who,each day, demand their bread from chance and not from toil, the unknownof poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong torevolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deedwhatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe for riot,and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to quiver, and tofeel himself borne away with the whirlwind.Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which formssuddenly in certain conditions of temperature, and which, as it eddiesabout, mounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, crushes, demolishes,uproots, bearing with it great natures and small, the strong man and thefeeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom itbears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one againstthe other.It communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable andextraordinary power. It fills the first-comer with the force of events;it converts everything into projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of arough stone, and a general of a porter.If we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, a littlerevolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: revoltstrengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It putsthe army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws outthe muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the socialframework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; it is almost hygiene. Poweris in better health after a revolt, as a man is after a good rubbingdown.Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.There is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself "good sense";Philintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and thetrue; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, becauseit is mingled with blame and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and is oftenonly pedantry. A whole political school called "the golden mean" hasbeen the outcome of this. As between cold water and hot water, it isthe lukewarm water party. This school with its false depth, all on thesurface, which dissects effects without going back to first causes,chides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation of the publicsquare.If we listen to this school, "The riots which complicated the affairof 1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. TheRevolution of July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followedby blue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused thatrevolution, at first so remarkable for its unanimity, to degenerate intoa quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress accomplished byfits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these riots renderedthem perceptible. It might have been said: 'Ah! this is broken.' Afterthe Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; after theriots, one was conscious of a catastrophe."All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchangeinto consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitatesfailures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public creditshaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount,fear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has beencalculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty millions,the second day forty, the third sixty, a three days' uprising costsone hundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the financialresult be taken into consideration, it is equivalent to a disaster, ashipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet of sixtyships of the line."No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of thepavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war ofthickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other theheart of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.Revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original pointsof the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, studentsproving that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guardinvincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins,contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and legions clashedtogether. After all, between the combatants, there was only a differenceof age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical men who died at theage of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their families. Thearmy, always a sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity.Uprisings, while proving popular intrepidity, also educated the courageof the bourgeois."This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshedadd the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among thebest men, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in thesewounds dealt to revolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830triumphing and saying: 'We told you so!' Add Paris enlarged, possibly,but France most assuredly diminished. Add, for all must needs be told,the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grownferocious over liberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have beendisastrous."Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie,that approximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.For our parts, we reject this word uprisings as too large, andconsequently as too convenient. We make a distinction between onepopular movement and another popular movement. We do not inquire whetheran uprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the first place?Here the question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than anuprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? Andwhat if the revolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? Theestablishment of Philip V. in Spain cost France two milliards. Even atthe same price, we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we rejectthese figures, which appear to be reasons and which are only words. Anuprising being given, we examine it by itself. In all that is said bythe doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question ofanything but effect, we seek the cause.We will be explicit.CHAPTER II--THE ROOT OF THE MATTERThere is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing asinsurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in thewrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only oneswhich are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fractionusurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights mayproceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions which result fromcollective sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction isinsurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt;according as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, theyare justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against thepopulace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th ofVendemiaire. Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality;the Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That whichuniversal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereigntycannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertainingpurely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sightedto-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate whendirected against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. Thedestruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking ofrails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, therefusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated bystudents, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,--that isrevolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome againstCicero,--that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,--that isinsurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors againstChristopher Columbus,--this is the same revolt; impious revolt;why? Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that whichChristopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexanderlike Columbus, is finding a world. These gifts of a world tocivilization are such augmentations of light, that all resistance inthat case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity toitself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for example,anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers incontraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisivemoment, on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory,espouses the throne, turns into chouannerie, and, from having been aninsurrection against, becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces ofignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, andwith a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. "Death tothe salt duties," brings forth, "Long live the King!" The assassins ofSaint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of September, the manslaughterers ofAvignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins of Madam Lamballe, theassassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions ofJehu, the chevaliers of Brassard,--behold an uprising. La Vendee isa grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right in movement isrecognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of excitedmasses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do notgive out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorancesis quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in whatdirection you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you maygrow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Anyother sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is arevolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the humanrace. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavementswhich the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. Thesepavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against LouisXIV. is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, asLafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the mostfatal of crimes.There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection isoften a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in power.Polignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers.Insurrection is sometimes resurrection.The solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutelymodern fact, and all history anterior to this fact being, for the spaceof four thousand years, filled with violated right, and the suffering ofpeoples, each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which itis capable. Under the Caesars, there was no insurrection, but there wasJuvenal.The facit indignatio replaces the Gracchi.Under the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also the man ofthe Annales. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on hispart also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of theideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts onRome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection ofthe Apocalypse. John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we mayunderstand him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writesthe Annales is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. Thework of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be pouredinto the channel a concentrated prose which bites.Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word thatis chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his stylewhen silence is imposed on a nation by its master. From this silencethere arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thoughtand there congeals into bronze. The compression of history producesconciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of such and such acelebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which areaugmentations of force. The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficedfor Verres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less spread of sail inthe phrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all hismight.The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth, overwhelmsas with lightning.Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically superposedupon Caesar. The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar and Tacitusare two successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to bemysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on thestage, regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great, Tacitusis great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clashwith one another. The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, mightstrike too hard and be unjust. God does not will it. The great warsof Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilizationintroduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,--all this glorycovers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of the divinejustice, hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper theformidable historian, sparing Caesar Tacitus, and according extenuatingcircumstances to genius.Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of genius.There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the moral pest isstill more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such reigns, nothing veilsthe shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus as well as Juvenal,slap this ignominy which cannot reply, in the face, more usefully in thepresence of all humanity.Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius andunder Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to therepulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a direct productof the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences whereinthe master is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;consciences are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under Caracalla,thus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus, while, fromthe Roman Senate, under Caesar, there comes nothing but the odor of thedung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals;it is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator makes hisappearance.But Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante inthe Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, whichis sometimes right and sometimes wrong.In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact;insurrection is always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello;insurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders on mind, riot on thestomach; Gaster grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always inthe wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, for example, holds atrue, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it remainsa riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in form. Shyalthough in the right, violent although strong, it struck at random; itwalked like a blind elephant; it left behind it the corpses of oldmen, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of inoffensive andinnocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment of the people is agood object; to massacre them is a bad means.All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th ofAugust, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Beforethe right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning, theinsurrection is a riot, just as a river is a torrent. Ordinarily it endsin that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those loftymountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason,right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall fromrock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency andincreased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph,insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in aswamp.All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal suffragehas this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in its inception,and, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of its arms.The disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars on thefrontiers, such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day may be,To-morrow will be peace.However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the formerand the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing of suchshades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, therevolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom must bepunished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, until such dayas the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in thegloom face to face with the lion.Then the bourgeois shouts: "Long live the people!"This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify,so far as history is concerned? Is it a revolt? Is it an insurrection?It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, tosay revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial facts,and always preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, andinsurrection, the foundation.This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholyextinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see in it only anuprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, itis like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to becalmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needsundergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like amountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura,nor Pyrenees without the Asturias.This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory ofParisians calls "the epoch of the riots," is certainly a characteristichour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enteron the recital.The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic andliving reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of timeand space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation,human tremor. Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, soto speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance ofhistory. The epoch, surnamed "of the riots," abounds in details ofthis nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have notsounded the depths, for another reason than history. We shall thereforebring to light, among the known and published peculiarities, thingswhich have not heretofore been known, about facts over which have passedthe forgetfulness of some, and the death of others. The majority of theactors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared; beginning with thevery next day they held their peace; but of what we shall relate, weshall be able to say: "We have seen this." We alter a few names, forhistory relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we shallpaint will be genuine. In accordance with the conditions of the bookwhich we are now writing, we shall show only one side and one episode,and certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and the6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the reader maycatch a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, ofthe real form of this frightful public adventure.CHAPTER III--A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAINIn the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling allminds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation anindescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripefor commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece ofartillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and theshot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of GeneralLamarque.Lamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession,under the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of braveryrequisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and thebravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; asword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, afterupholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left andthe extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chancesof the future, beloved of the populace because he had served theEmperor well; he was, in company with Comtes Gerard and Drouet, oneof Napoleon's marshals in petto. The treaties of 1815 removed him asa personal offence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred whichpleased the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majesticallypreserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention tointervening events. In his death agony, at his last hour, he clasped tohis breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers ofthe Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word army, Lamarqueuttering the word country.His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, andby the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Likeeverything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is whattook place.On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the dayappointed for Lamarque's burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which theprocession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This tumultuousnetwork of streets was filled with rumors. They armed themselves as bestthey might. Joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment"to break down doors." One of them had made himself a dagger of astocking-weaver's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening thestump. Another, who was in a fever "to attack," slept wholly dressedfor three days. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who asked him:"Whither are you going?" "Eh! well, I have no weapons." "What then?""I'm going to my timber-yard to get my compasses." "What for?" "I don'tknow," said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accostedsome passing artisans: "Come here, you!" He treated them to ten sous'worth of wine and said: "Have you work?" "No." "Go to Filspierre,between the Barriere Charonne and the Barriere Montreuil, and you willfind work." At Filspierre's they found cartridges and arms. Certainwell-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running fromone house to another, to collect their men. At Barthelemy's, near theBarriere du Trone, at Capel's, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkersaccosted each other with a grave air. They were heard to say: "Have youyour pistol?" "Under my blouse." "And you?" "Under my shirt." In theRue Traversiere, in front of the Bland workshop, and in the yard ofthe Maison-Brulee, in front of tool-maker Bernier's, groups whisperedtogether. Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remainedmore than a week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him"because they were obliged to dispute with him every day." Mavot waskilled on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Menilmontant.Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, seconded Mavot,and to the question: "What is your object?" he replied: "Insurrection."Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy, waited for acertain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg Saint-Marceau.Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly.On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, GeneralLamarque's funeral procession traversed Paris with official militarypomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with drapeddrums and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swordsat their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men.The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurelbranches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, thesectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the MedicalSchool, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German,and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort ofbanner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters whowere on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by theirpaper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearlyall of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without orderand yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column.Squads chose themselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols infull view, seemed to pass the host in review, and the files separatedbefore him. On the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of thetrees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men,women, and children; all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throngwas passing, and a terrified throng looked on.The Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed withits hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen inthe Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head,cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to march;in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guardechelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron ofdragoons; at the Greve half of the 12th Light Infantry, the otherhalf being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins; and thecourtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of the troopswere confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of theenvirons of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacingmultitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousandin the banlieue.Divers reports were in circulation in the cortege. Legitimist trickswere hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had markedout for death at that very moment when the populace were designatinghim for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown,announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over,would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people. Thatwhich predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of thosepresent was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, inthat multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there werevisible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said: "Letus plunder!" There are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms ofmarshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon towhich "well drilled" policemen are no strangers.The procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of thedeceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rainedfrom time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Manyincidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown atthe Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on hishead, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin,an officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: "I am a Republican,"the Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against orders to remainat home, the shouts of: "Long live the Polytechnique! Long live theRepublic!" marked the passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille,long files of curious and formidable people who descended from theFaubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and acertain terrible seething began to agitate the throng.One man was heard to say to another: "Do you see that fellow with ared beard, he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire." Itappears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quenissetaffair, entrusted with this same function.The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reachedthe esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,surveyed at that moment with a bird'seye view, would have presented theaspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spreadout over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was prolonged onthe boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle was tracedaround the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette spoke andbade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching and august instant, allheads uncovered, all hearts beat high.All at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearancein the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pikesurmounted with a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head.Exelmans quitted the procession.This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. Fromthe Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamorswhich resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts wentup: "Lamarque to the Pantheon!--Lafayette to the Town-hall!" Some youngmen, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves andbegan to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz andLafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticedthat a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a centenarianafterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who had fought atTrenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under Lafayette.In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been setin motion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoonsemerged from the Celestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The menwho were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the cornerof the quay and shouted: "The dragoons!" The dragoons advanced at awalk, in silence, with their pistols in their holsters, their swords intheir scabbards, their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an airof gloomy expectation.They halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage inwhich sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened and allowed itto pass, and then closed behind it. At that moment the dragoons and thecrowd touched. The women fled in terror. What took place during thatfatal minute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds cometogether. Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge washeard in the direction of the Arsenal others that a blow from a daggerwas given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that three shots weresuddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of the squadron,the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing herwindow, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed:"They are beginning too soon!" and all at once, a squadron of dragoonswhich had remained in the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouchat a gallop with bared swords, through the Rue Bassompierre and theBoulevard Bourdon, sweeping all before them.Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusilladebreaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank, andpass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of theIsle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with combatants,stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young menwho are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run,and the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply theirswords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies toall four quarters of Paris, men shout: "To arms!" they run, tumble down,flee, resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire.CHAPTER IV--THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYSNothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot.Everything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was itprepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. Whence falls it? Fromthe clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a plot; thereof an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current of the throngand leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which ismingled a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops areclosed, the displays of the merchants disappear; then come isolatedshots; people flee; blows from gun-stocks beat against portes cocheres,servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying:"There's going to be a row!"A quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking placeat twenty different spots in Paris at once.In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, bearded andwith long hair, entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later, carryinga horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape, and having at theirhead three men armed, one with a sword, one with a gun, and the thirdwith a pike.In the Rue des Nonaindieres, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had aprominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, a blackbeard, and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat, offeredcartridges publicly to passers-by.In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about ablack flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription:"Republic or Death!" In the Rue des Jeuneurs, Rue du Cadran, RueMontorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared waving flags on which could bedistinguished in gold letters, the word section with a number. One ofthese flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe ofwhite between.They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, andthree armorers' shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second in theRue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few minutes,the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundredand thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, andeighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took thegun, the other the bayonet.Opposite the Quai de la Greve, young men armed with muskets installedthemselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. Oneof them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about makingcartridges. One of these women relates: "I did not know what cartridgeswere; it was my husband who told me."One cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des ViellesHaudriettes, and seized yataghans and Turkish arms.The body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue dela Perle.And then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on theboulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, pantingmen, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations andshouted: "To arms!" broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages,unpaved the streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees,rummaged cellars, rolled out hogsheads, heaped up paving-stones, roughslabs, furniture and planks, and made barricades.They forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered thedwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and gunsof their absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting: "Thearms have been delivered"; some signed "their names" to receipts forthe guns and swords and said: "Send for them to-morrow at the Mayor'soffice." They disarmed isolated sentinels and National Guardsmen inthe streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore the epaulets fromofficers. In the Rue du Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas, an officer of theNational Guard, on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils,took refuge with difficulty in a house, whence he was only able toemerge at nightfall and in disguise.In the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of theirhotels and ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Cafe du Progress,or descended to the Cafe des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins.There, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stonecorner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard in theRue Transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades. On a singlepoint the inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoyeand the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade withtheir own hands. At a single point the insurgents yielded; theyabandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired ona detachment of the National Guard, and fled through the Rue de laCorderie. The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, apackage of cartridges, and three hundred pistol-balls. The NationalGuardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off its tattered remains on thepoints of their bayonets.All that we are here relating slowly and successively took placesimultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. In less thanan hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarterof the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, whichwas the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which,flanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the otherby a barricade of the Rue Maubuee, commanded three streets, the Ruedes Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, whichit faced. The barricades at right angles fell back, the one of theRue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the RueGeoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerablebarricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, atMont-Sainte-Genevieve; one in the Rue Menilmontant, where was visiblea porte cochere torn from its hinges; another near the little bridge ofthe Hotel-Dieu made with an "ecossais," which had been unharnessed andoverthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.At the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers, a well-dressed mandistributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat,a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to bethe commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll ofsilver. "Here," said he, "this is to pay expenses, wine, et caetera."A light-haired young man, without a cravat, went from barricade tobarricade, carrying pass-words. Another, with a naked sword, a bluepolice cap on his head, placed sentinels. In the interior, beyond thebarricades, the wine-shops and porters' lodges were converted intoguard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientificmilitary tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of anglesand turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, inparticular, a network of streets more intricate than a forest. TheSociety of the Friends of the People had, it was said, undertaken todirect the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man killed inthe Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris.That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was asort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrectionhad abruptly built barricades with one hand, and with the other seizednearly all the posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like atrain of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied,on the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, thewhole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, theChateau-d'Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank,the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pelagie, the Place Maubert, thepowder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At fiveo'clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of theLingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Placedes Victoires, and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Peres barracks, and thePost-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters.The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; and, as aresult of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers' shops hastilyinvaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing ofstones was continued with gun-shots.About six o'clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the fieldof battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the other.They fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer, theauthor of this book, who had gone to get a near view of this volcano,found himself in the passage between the two fires. All that he had toprotect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half-columns whichseparate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearlyhalf an hour.Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed inhaste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments fromtheir barracks. Opposite the passage de l'Ancre a drummer received ablow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by thirtyyoung men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword. Another waskilled in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue-Michelle-Comte, threeofficers fell dead one after the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, onbeing wounded, in the Rue des Lombards, retreated.In front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a redflag bearing the following inscription: Republican revolution, No. 127.Was this a revolution, in fact?The insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable,tortuous, colossal citadel.There was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the restwas nothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided therelay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet.In some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to thefearful uncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovationwhich had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830.Two intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and GeneralBugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud under Lobau. Enormous patrols,composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in entire companies of theNational Guard, and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarfof office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The insurgents,on their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces, andaudaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each side waswatching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated;the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to makeitself heard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, who hadseen Austerlitz, regarded this with a gloomy air.These old sailors, accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having asresource and guide only tactics, that compass of battles, are utterlydisconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called publicwrath.The National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder. Abattalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, the 14th ofthe Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the Military Schoolhad taken up their position on the Carrousel; cannons were descendingfrom Vincennes.Solitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was perfectlyserene.CHAPTER V--ORIGINALITY OF PARISDuring the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed morethan one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm thanthe physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds ofthe rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself toanything,--it is only a riot,--and Paris has so many affairs on hand,that she does not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossalcities alone can offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alonecan contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribabletranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when theshop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, hecontents himself with the remark:--"There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin."Or:--"In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine."Often he adds carelessly:--"Or somewhere in that direction."Later on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry andfiring by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:--"It's getting hot! Hullo, it's getting hot!"A moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up hisshop precipitately, hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, he placeshis merchandise in safety and risks his own person.Men fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take andre-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the frontsof the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber thestreets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be heard inthe cafes.The theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious laughand chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled withwar. Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going to a dinnersomewhere in town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting isgoing on.In 1831, a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass.At the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin alittle, infirm old man, pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricoloredrag, in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid, went andcame from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade, offeringhis glasses of cocoa impartially,--now to the Government, now toanarchy.Nothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of uprisingsin Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this end, twothings are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The city ofVoltaire and Napoleon is necessary.On this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 25th, 1832, thegreat city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. Itwas afraid.Closed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in themost distant and most "disinterested" quarters. The courageous took toarms, the poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared.Many streets were empty at four o'clock in the morning.Alarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,--thatthey were masters of the Bank;--that there were six hundred of themin the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in thechurch; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrelhad been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: "Get aregiment first"; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,nevertheless: "I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is roomfor a chair"; that one must be on one's guard; that at night there wouldbe people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of Paris(there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed up withthe Government was recognizable); that a battery had been establishedin the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting theirheads together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, fourcolumns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, thefirst coming from the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin,the third from the Greve, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps,also, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars;that no one knew what would happen, but that this time, it certainly wasserious.People busied themselves over Marshal Soult's hesitations. Why did nothe attack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed. Theold lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom.Evening came, the theatres did not open; the patrols circulated withan air of irritation; passers-by were searched; suspicious persons werearrested. By nine o'clock, more than eight hundred persons had beenarrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, so was theConciergerie, so was La Force.At the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called theRue de Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heapof prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly.All that straw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavyshower. Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piledon top of each other.Anxiety reigned everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitualwith Paris.People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers wereuneasy; nothing was to be heard but this: "Ah! my God! He has not comehome!" There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to beheard.People listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, thetumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that weresaid: "It is cavalry," or: "Those are the caissons galloping," to thetrumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentablealarm peal from Saint-Merry.They waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners ofthe streets and disappeared, shouting: "Go home!" And people made hasteto bolt their doors. They said: "How will all this end?" From moment tomoment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take ona more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.BOOK ELEVENTH.--THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANECHAPTER I--SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE'SPOETRY. THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRYAt the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of thepopulace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movementin advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following thehearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards, weighed,so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful ebb.The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made theirescape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight.The great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling,overflowed to right and left, and spread in torrents over two hundredstreets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose.At that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the RueMenilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum whichhe had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an oldholster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant's shop."Mother What's-your-name, I'm going to borrow your machine."And off he ran with the pistol.Two minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeingthrough the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered the ladbrandishing his pistol and singing:--               La nuit on ne voit rien,               Le jour on voit tres bien,               D'un ecrit apocrypha               Le bourgeois s'ebouriffe,               Pratiquez la vertu,               Tutu, chapeau pointu![44]It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? Weknow not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was wellup in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them hisown chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri ofthe voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertoryof the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted withthieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, beenfor three months apprenticed to a printer. He had one day executed acommission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gaminof letters.Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offeredthe hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainouslyrainy night, it was to his own brothers that he had played the part ofProvidence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning;that is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Balletsat daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artisticallyextracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort ofbreakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confidingthem to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almostentirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the samespot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of afarewell: "I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, asthey say at the court, I file off. If you don't find papa and mamma,young 'uns, come back here this evening. I'll scramble you up somesupper, and I'll give you a shakedown." The two children, picked up bysome policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank,or having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris,did not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full ofthese lost traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weekshad elapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the backof his head and said: "Where the devil are my two children?"In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue duPont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in thatstreet, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a pastry-cook'sshop. This presented a providential occasion to eat anotherapple-turnover before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled inhis fob, turned his pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou,and began to shout: "Help!"It is hard to miss the last cake.Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.Two minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing theRue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss of theapple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged himself in theimmense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight.A little further on, on catching sight of a group of comfortable-lookingpersons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he shrugged his shouldersand spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile asthey passed:"How fat those moneyed men are! They're drunk! They just wallow in gooddinners. Ask 'em what they do with their money. They don't know. Theyeat it, that's what they do! As much as their bellies will hold."CHAPTER II--GAVROCHE ON THE MARCHThe brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one's hand in theopen street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt hisfervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaisewhich he was singing, he shouted:--"All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I'm all brokenup with rheumatism, but I'm satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeoishave to do is to bear themselves well, I'll sneeze them out subversivecouplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I'd just like to haveone of them at the end of my pistol. I'm just from the boulevard, myfriends. It's getting hot there, it's getting into a little boil, it'ssimmering. It's time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impureblood inundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall neversee my concubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Longlive joy! Let's fight, crebleu! I've had enough of despotism."At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard havingfallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up theman, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up hispistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace andsilence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast withthe vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway.Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossipinghags; and the "Thou shalt be King" could be quite as mournfully hurledat Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath ofArmuyr. The croak would be almost identical.The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their ownconcerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-pickerwith her basket on her back.All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is therag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is causedby the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will ofthe portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. Theremay be kindness in the broom.This rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what asmile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:--"Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?""Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It'sthe dogs who complain.""And people also.""But the fleas from a cat don't go after people.""That's not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one yearwhen there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in thenewspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries greatsheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you rememberthe King of Rome?""I liked the Duc de Bordeau better.""I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII.""Meat is awfully dear, isn't it, Mother Patagon?""Ah! don't mention it, the butcher's shop is a horror. A horriblehorror--one can't afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays."Here the rag-picker interposed:--"Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one throwsanything away any more. They eat everything.""There are poorer people than you, la Vargouleme.""Ah, that's true," replied the rag-picker, with deference, "I have aprofession."A pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity forboasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:--"In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort mythings. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, thecores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollenstuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window,the things that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in myfireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed."Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening."Old ladies," said he, "what do you mean by talking politics?"He was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl."Here's another rascal.""What's that he's got in his paddle? A pistol?""Well, I'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is?""That sort of animal is never easy unless he's overturning theauthorities."Gavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, withelevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.The rag-picker cried:--"You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!"The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands togetherin horror."There's going to be evil doings, that's certain. The errand-boy nextdoor has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with ayoung person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, andhe had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was arevolution at--at--at--where's the calf!--at Pontoise. And then, thereyou see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that theCelestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government cando with good-for-nothings who don't know how to do anything but contriveways of upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a littlequiet after all the misfortunes that have happened, good Lord! to thatpoor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is going tomake tobacco dearer. It's infamous! And I shall certainly go to see himbeheaded on the guillotine, the wretch!""You've got the sniffles, old lady," said Gavroche. "Blow yourpromontory."And he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavee, the rag-picker occurredto his mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:--"You're in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, MotherDust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It's so that you mayhave more good things to eat in your basket."All at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagonwho had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in thedistance and crying:--"You're nothing but a bastard.""Oh! Come now," said Gavroche, "I don't care a brass farthing for that!"Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered thisappeal:--"Forward march to the battle!"And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol withan air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:--"I'm going off," said he, "but you won't go off!"One dog may distract the attention from another dog.[45] A very gauntpoodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him."My poor doggy," said he, "you must have gone and swallowed a cask, forall the hoops are visible."Then he directed his course towards l'Orme-Saint-Gervais.CHAPTER III--JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSERThe worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two littlefellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of theelephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an oldsoldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They weretalking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of theriot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed tothe Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber andsoldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched witharabesques, and which he would have entitled: "Dialogue between therazor and the sword.""How did the Emperor ride, sir?" said the barber."Badly. He did not know how to fall--so he never fell.""Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!""On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was aracing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddledeep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, stronglyarticulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerfulcrupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height.""A pretty horse," remarked the hair-dresser."It was His Majesty's beast."The hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silencewould be fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:--"The Emperor was never wounded but once, was he, sir?"The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man whohad been there:--"In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on thatday. He was as neat as a new sou.""And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?""I?" said the soldier, "ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, Ireceived two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the rightarm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland,a thrust from a bayonet, there,--at the Moskowa seven or eightlance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushedone of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaien inthe thigh, that's all.""How fine that is!" exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, "todie on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed,of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms,syringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in mybelly!""You're not over fastidious," said the soldier.He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. Theshow-window had suddenly been fractured.The wig-maker turned pale."Ah, good God!" he exclaimed, "it's one of them!""What?""A cannon-ball.""Here it is," said the soldier.And he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. It was apebble.The hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeingat the full speed, towards the Marche Saint-Jean. As he passed thehair-dresser's shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind,had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and hadflung a stone through his panes."You see!" shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue,"that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it. Whathas any one done to that gamin?"CHAPTER IV--THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MANIn the meantime, in the Marche Saint-Jean, where the post had alreadybeen disarmed, Gavroche had just "effected a junction" with a band ledby Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feuilly. They were armed aftera fashion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled thegroup. Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gunof a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, and in his belt,two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen, Jean Prouvairean old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; Courfeyrac was brandishing anunsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in his hand, marchedat their head shouting: "Long live Poland!"They reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soakedby the rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted themcalmly:--"Where are we going?""Come along," said Courfeyrac.Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fishin water in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged inthe sort of words which break everything. His waistcoat astounded apasser-by, who cried in bewilderment:--"Here are the reds!""The reds, the reds!" retorted Bahorel. "A queer kind of fear,bourgeois. For my part I don't tremble before a poppy, the little redhat inspires me with no alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let's leavefear of the red to horned cattle."He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded themost peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, aLenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his "flock."Bahorel exclaimed:--"'Flock'; a polite way of saying geese."And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From thatinstant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel."Bahorel," observed Enjolras, "you are wrong. You should have let thatcharge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you arewasting your wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. One does notfire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun.""Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras," retorted Bahorel. "Thisbishop's prose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without being permitted.Your style is the hot and cold; I am amusing myself. Besides, I'm notwasting myself, I'm getting a start; and if I tore down that charge,Hercle! 'twas only to whet my appetite."This word, Hercle, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions forlearning, and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. Heinquired of him:--"What does Hercle mean?"Bahorel answered:--"It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin."Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beardwho was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C. Heshouted to him:--"Quick, cartridges, para bellum.""A fine man! that's true," said Gavroche, who now understood Latin.A tumultuous retinue accompanied them,--students, artists, young menaffiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, armed withclubs and bayonets; some, like Combeferre, with pistols thrust intotheir trousers.An old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band.He had no arms, and he made great haste, so that he might not be leftbehind, although he had a thoughtful air.Gavroche caught sight of him:--"Keksekca?" said he to Courfeyrac."He's an old duffer."It was M. Mabeuf.CHAPTER V--THE OLD MANLet us recount what had taken place.Enjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, near thepublic storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made theircharge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre were among those who hadtaken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: "To the barricades!" In the RueLesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along. What had attractedtheir attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as thoughhe were intoxicated. Moreover, he had his hat in his hand, although ithad been raining all the morning, and was raining pretty briskly at thevery time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him throughhaving many times accompanied Marius as far as his door. As he wasacquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the oldbeadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of him in the midstof that uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry charges, almost inthe midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, and strolling about amongthe bullets, he had accosted him, and the following dialogue had beenexchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian:--"M. Mabeuf, go to your home.""Why?""There's going to be a row.""That's well.""Thrusts with the sword and firing, M. Mabeuf.""That is well.""Firing from cannon.""That is good. Where are the rest of you going?""We are going to fling the government to the earth.""That is good."And he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he had notuttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; artisans had offeredhim their arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advancednearly to the front rank of the column, with the movement of a man whois marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping."What a fierce old fellow!" muttered the students. The rumor spreadthrough the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,--an oldregicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.Little Gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made ofhim a sort of trumpet.He sang:       "Voici la lune qui paratt,        Quand irons-nous dans la foret?        Demandait Charlot a Charlotte.             Tou tou tou             Pour Chatou.        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.        "Pour avoir bu de grand matin         La rosee a meme le thym,         Deux moineaux etaient en ribotte.             Zi zi zi             Pour Passy.        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.       "Et ces deux pauvres petits loups,        Comme deux grives estaient souls;        Une tigre en riait dans sa grotte.             Don don don             Pour Meudon.        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.       "L'un jurait et l'autre sacrait.        Quand irons nous dans la foret?        Demandait Charlot a Charlotte.             Tin tin tin             Pour Pantin.         Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte."[46]They directed their course towards Saint-Merry.CHAPTER VI--RECRUITSThe band augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, a man oflofty stature, whose hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daringmien was remarked by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whomnone of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied in singing,whistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of theshops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to thisman.It chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front ofCourfeyrac's door."This happens just right," said Courfeyrac, "I have forgotten my purse,and I have lost my hat."He quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed. He seizedan old hat and his purse.He also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions of a largevalise, which was concealed under his soiled linen.As he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:--"Monsieur de Courfeyrac!""What's your name, portress?"The portress stood bewildered."Why, you know perfectly well, I'm the concierge; my name is MotherVeuvain.""Well, if you call me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I shall call youMother de Veuvain. Now speak, what's the matter? What do you want?""There is some one who wants to speak with you.""Who is it?""I don't know.""Where is he?""In my lodge.""The devil!" ejaculated Courfeyrac."But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour," said theportress.At the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthfulartisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbedvelvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than ofa man, emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice whichwas not the least in the world like a woman's voice:--"Monsieur Marius, if you please.""He is not here.""Will he return this evening?""I know nothing about it."And Courfeyrac added:--"For my part, I shall not return."The young man gazed steadily at him and said:--"Why not?""Because.""Where are you going, then?""What business is that of yours?""Would you like to have me carry your coffer for you?""I am going to the barricades.""Would you like to have me go with you?""If you like!" replied Courfeyrac. "The street is free, the pavementsbelong to every one."And he made his escape at a run to join his friends. When he hadrejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. It was onlya quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man, who hadactually followed them.A mob does not go precisely where it intends. We have explained thata gust of wind carries it away. They overshot Saint-Merry and foundthemselves, without precisely knowing how, in the Rue Saint-Denis.BOOK TWELFTH.--CORINTHECHAPTER I--HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATIONThe Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the endnear the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, abasket-maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleonthe Great with this inscription:--                    NAPOLEON IS MADE                    WHOLLY OF WILLOW,have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessedhardly thirty years ago.It was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deedsspell Chanverrerie, and the celebrated public-house called Corinthe.The reader will remember all that has been said about the barricadeeffected at this point, and eclipsed, by the way, by the barricadeSaint-Merry. It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de laChanvrerie, now fallen into profound obscurity, that we are about toshed a little light.May we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital,to the simple means which we have already employed in the case ofWaterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exactmanner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near thePointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris,where to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only toimagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halleswith its base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de laGrande-Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transversebar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old RueMondetour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles,so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed toform, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles and the RueSaint-Denis on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Ruedes Precheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, ofvarying sizes, placed crosswise and hap-hazard, and barely separated,like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.We say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those dark,contracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings. Thesebuildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Ruede la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams runningfrom one house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad,the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet, skirtinglittle stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops,excessive heaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century-oldgratings. The Rue Rambuteau has devastated all that.The name of Mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of thatwhole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still betterexpressed by the Rue Pirouette, which ran into the Rue Mondetour.The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue dela Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he hadentered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was veryshort, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Hallesby a tall row of houses, and he would have thought himself in a blindalley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts throughwhich he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondetour, which onone side ran into the Rue de Precheurs, and on the other into the Ruedu Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort ofcul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to beseen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sortof cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, thatan illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred yearsbefore. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which oldTheophilus described in the following couplet:--               La branle le squelette horrible               D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit.[47]The situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there,from father to son.In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called thePot-aux-Roses, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for itssign-board, a post (poteau) painted rose-color. In the last century, theworthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by thestiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at thevery table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way ofgratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of thecabaret, in his joy, had changed his device and had caused to be placedin gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: "At the Bunch of CorinthGrapes" ("Au Raisin de Corinthe"). Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothingis more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is thezig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses.The last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longeracquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the firstfloor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase piercingthe ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broaddaylight,--this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with atrap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor werethe lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircasewhich was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entranceonly a private door in the large room on the first floor. Under theroof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants. Thekitchen shared the ground-floor with the tap-room.Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact isthat he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alonein his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capitalthing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps,which he called carpes au gras. These were eaten by the light of atallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to whichwere nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came thitherfrom a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to notifypassers-by of this "specialty"; he had dipped a brush in a pot of blackpaint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as well asa cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall thisremarkable inscription:--                    CARPES HO GRAS.One winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy toobliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which beganthe third; this is what remained:--                      CARPE HO RAS.Time and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had becomea profound piece of advice.In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, FatherHucheloup understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from hiskitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalledHorace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:"Enter my wine-shop."Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondetour labyrinth wasdisembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer existsat the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe havedisappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not therallying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who haddiscovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the Carpe horas,and had returned thither on account of the Carpes au gras. There theydrank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, theypaid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.Father Hucheloup was a jovial host.Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeperwith a mustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered air,seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people whoentered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrelwith them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist uponthe word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had attractedcustomers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to eachother: "Come hear Father Hucheloup growl." He had been a fencing-master.All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big voice, a goodfellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior, he askednothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff-boxeswhich are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.Mother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret ofstuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop.But the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which hadalways been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and hisfriends continued to go to Corinthe,--out of pity, as Bossuet said.The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rusticrecollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation.She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced herreminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly beenher delight, so she affirmed, to hear the loups-de-gorge (rouges-gorges)chanter dans les ogrepines (aubepines)--to hear the redbreasts sing inthe hawthorn-trees.The hall on the first floor, where "the restaurant" was situated, wasa large and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, andtables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reachedby a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at asquare hole like the hatchway of a ship.This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that wasalways burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniturecomported itself as though it had but three legs--the whitewashed wallshad for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of MameHucheloup:--          Elle etonne a dix pas, elle epouvente a deux,          Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux;          On tremble a chaque instant qu'elle ne vous la mouche          Et qu'un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.[48]This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.Mame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning tillnight before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Twoserving-maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,[49] and who had never beenknown by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tablesthe jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to thehungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,and noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, washomelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as itbecomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she wasless homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with alymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, alwayslanguid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude,the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, eventhe other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with avague and sleepy smile.Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door thefollowing line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:--          Regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses.[50]CHAPTER II--PRELIMINARY GAYETIESLaigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly thanelsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. Thetwo friends lived together, ate together, slept together. They hadeverything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, whatthe subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, bini. On themorning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly,who was all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning toshare. Laigle's coat was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed.It was about nine o'clock in the morning, when they opened the door ofCorinthe.They ascended to the first floor.Matelote and Gibelotte received them."Oysters, cheese, and ham," said Laigle.And they seated themselves at a table.The wine-shop was empty; there was no one there but themselves.Gibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table.While they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at thehatchway of the staircase, and a voice said:--"I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Briecheese. I enter." It was Grantaire.Grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table.At the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on thetable.That made three."Are you going to drink those two bottles?" Laigle inquired ofGrantaire.Grantaire replied:--"All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two bottles never yetastonished a man."The others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. Half abottle was rapidly gulped down."So you have a hole in your stomach?" began Laigle again."You have one in your elbow," said Grantaire.And after having emptied his glass, he added:--"Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old.""I should hope so," retorted Laigle. "That's why we get on welltogether, my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does not bindme anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all mymovements, I am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old coatsare just like old friends.""That's true," ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, "an old goatis an old abi" (ami, friend)."Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up," saidGrantaire."Grantaire," demanded Laigle, "have you just come from the boulevard?""No.""We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I.""It's a marvellous sight," said Joly."How quiet this street is!" exclaimed Laigle. "Who would suspect thatParis was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that informer days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood!Du Breul and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbe Lebeuf.They were all round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted,shaven, bearded, gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins,Carmelites, Little Augustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines--therewas no end of them.""Don't let's talk of monks," interrupted Grantaire, "it makes one wantto scratch one's self."Then he exclaimed:--"Bouh! I've just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is takingpossession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly.I hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in frontof the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is calleda library is disgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink! Whatscrawling! And all that has been written! What rascal was it who saidthat man was a featherless biped?[51] And then, I met a pretty girl ofmy acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be calledFloreal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the angels,because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted withsmall-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on thewatch for a protector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as wellas birds. Two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, sheadjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what doyou call it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a potof flowers, she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. Thistransformation took place last night. I met the victim this morning inhigh spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as prettyto-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face.Roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the tracesleft upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality onearth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel,the symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, theapple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and thefig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know whatright is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demandswhat wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: 'The wrong thatAlba did to you, the wrong that Fidenae did to you, the wrong that theEques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were yourneighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just asyou do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.' Rome said: 'Youshall not take Clusium.' Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: 'Vae victis!'That is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world!What eagles! It makes my flesh creep."He held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went on,having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine, of which no one,not even himself, had taken any notice:--"Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisetteis an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other.So we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink. Whatever youropinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, orin favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little,drink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that procession, et caetera,et caetera. Come now, is there going to be another revolution? Thispoverty of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keepgreasing the groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won'twork. Quick, a revolution! The good God has his hands perpetually blackwith that cart-grease. If I were in his place, I'd be perfectly simpleabout it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I'd lead thehuman race in a straightforward way, I'd weave matters mesh by mesh,without breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements,I would have no extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you callprogress advances by means of two motors, men and events. But, sad tosay, from time to time, the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinarytroupe suffices neither for event nor for men: among men geniuses arerequired, among events revolutions. Great accidents are the law; theorder of things cannot do without them; and, judging from the apparitionof comets, one would be tempted to think that Heaven itself finds actorsneeded for its performance. At the moment when one expects it the least,God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer starturns up, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the deathof Caesar. Brutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with acomet. Crac, and behold an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, beholda great man; '93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811at the head of the poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studdedwith unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise youreyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star as well as the drama.Good God, it is too much and not enough. These resources, gathered fromexception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends, Providence hascome down to expedients. What does a revolution prove? That God is in aquandry. He effects a coup d'etat because he, God, has not been able tomake both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in my conjectures asto Jehovah's fortune; and when I see so much distress in heaven and onearth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without ahundred thousand livres of income, when I see human destiny, which isvery badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witnessthe Prince de Conde hung, when I see winter, which is nothing but a rentin the zenith through which the wind blows, when I see so many rags evenin the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills, whenI see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost, thatpaste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and somany spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see somuch misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearanceexists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolutionas a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives a ball. God must not bejudged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceivea poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt. That is why I amdiscontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever sincethis morning I have been waiting for daylight to come; it has not come,and I bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness of anill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anythingelse, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition,everything goes awry; the universe is a tease. It's like children, thosewho want them have none, and those who don't want them have them. Total:I'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head, offends my sight.It humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy.However, I criticise, but I do not insult. The universe is what it is.I speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience. Receive,Eternal Father, the assurance of my distinguished consideration. Ah!by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of paradise, I was notintended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, like ashuttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the loungers tothe group of the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching orientalhouris all day long, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, assensuous as the dream of a chaste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or aVenetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewomen, or a petty German prince,furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation, andoccupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge, that is tosay, his frontier. Those are the positions for which I was born! Yes, Ihave said a Turk, and I will not retract. I do not understand how peoplecan habitually take Turks in bad part; Mohammed had his good points;respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises withodalisques! Let us not insult Mohammedanism, the only religion which isornamented with a hen-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is agreat piece of stupidity. And it appears that they are going to fight,all those imbeciles, and to break each other's profiles and to massacreeach other in the heart of summer, in the month of June, when they mightgo off with a creature on their arm, to breathe the immense heaps ofnew-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit altogethertoo many follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at abric-a-brac merchant's suggests a reflection to my mind; it is time toenlighten the human race. Yes, behold me sad again. That's what comesof swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way! I am growingmelancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive, turn eachother out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get used to it!"And Grantaire, after this fit of eloquence, had a fit of coughing, whichwas well earned."A propos of revolution," said Joly, "it is decidedly abberent thatBarius is in lub.""Does any one know with whom?" demanded Laigle."Do.""No?""Do! I tell you.""Marius' love affairs!" exclaimed Grantaire. "I can imagine it. Mariusis a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race ofpoets. He who says poet, says fool, madman, Tymbraeus Apollo. Marius andhis Marie, or his Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must makea queer pair of lovers. I know just what it is like. Ecstasies in whichthey forget to kiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They are soulspossessed of senses. They lie among the stars."Grantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his secondharangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of thestairs. It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small,yellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hairdrenched with rain, and wearing a contented air.The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressedhimself to Laigle de Meaux."Are you Monsieur Bossuet?""That is my nickname," replied Laigle. "What do you want with me?""This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: 'Do you knowMother Hucheloup?' I said: 'Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, the old man's widow;'he said to me: 'Go there. There you will find M. Bossuet. Tell him fromme: "A B C".' It's a joke that they're playing on you, isn't it. He gaveme ten sous.""Joly, lend me ten sous," said Laigle; and, turning to Grantaire:"Grantaire, lend me ten sous."This made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad."Thank you, sir," said the urchin."What is your name?" inquired Laigle."Navet, Gavroche's friend.""Stay with us," said Laigle."Breakfast with us," said Grantaire.The child replied:--"I can't, I belong in the procession, I'm the one to shout 'Down withPolignac!'"And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is themost respectful of all possible salutes, he took his departure.The child gone, Grantaire took the word:--"That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of thegamin species. The notary's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook'sgamin is called a scullion, the baker's gamin is called a mitron,the lackey's gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is called thecabin-boy, the soldier's gamin is called the drummer-boy, the painter'sgamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman's gamin is called anerrand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly gaminis called the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino."In the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:--"A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque.""The tall blonde," remarked Grantaire, "is Enjolras, who is sending youa warning.""Shall we go?" ejaculated Bossuet."It's raiding," said Joly. "I have sworn to go through fire, but notthrough water. I don't wand to ged a gold.""I shall stay here," said Grantaire. "I prefer a breakfast to a hearse.""Conclusion: we remain," said Laigle. "Well, then, let us drink.Besides, we might miss the funeral without missing the riot.""Ah! the riot, I am with you!" cried Joly.Laigle rubbed his hands."Now we're going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter offact, it does hurt the people along the seams.""I don't think much of your revolution," said Grantaire. "I don'texecrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the cottonnight-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I thinkthat to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize hisroyalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre endagainst the people, and open the umbrella end against heaven."The room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction ofdaylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or in the street, every onehaving gone off "to watch events.""Is it mid-day or midnight?" cried Bossuet. "You can't see your handbefore your face. Gibelotte, fetch a light."Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way."Enjolras disdains me," he muttered. "Enjolras said: 'Joly is ill,Grantaire is drunk.' It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he hadcome for me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras!I won't go to his funeral."This resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did notstir from the wine-shop. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the table atwhich they sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burningon it, one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, theother in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly andBossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towardscheerfulness.As for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderateinspirer of dreams, ever since mid-day. Wine enjoys only a conventionalpopularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matterof inebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic.Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terriblefit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him, attractedhim. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. Thebeer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, andbeing desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had recourseto that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces themost terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy,and absinthe, that the lead of the soul is composed. They are threegrooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there are formedthere in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat,three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about theslumbering Psyche.Grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He wastremendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked glasses.Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas,a peculiarity of gesture; he rested his left fist on his knee withdignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat untied, seatedastride a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled solemnwords at the big maid-servant Matelote:--"Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a memberof the French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup.Let us drink."And turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:--"Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplatethee!"And Joly exclaimed:--"Matelote and Gibelotte, dod't gib Grantaire anything more to drink.He has already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, twofrancs and ninety-five centibes."And Grantaire began again:--"Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and puttingthem on the table in the guise of candles?"Bossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity.He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in thefalling rain, and gazing at his two friends.All at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of"To arms!" He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the endof the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and Gavrochewith his pistol, Feuilly with his sword, Courfeyrac with his sword, andJean Prouvaire with his blunderbuss, Combeferre with his gun, Bahorelwith his gun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was followingthem.The Rue de la Chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long. Bossuetimprovised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed around hismouth, and shouted:--"Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohee!"Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a fewpaces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: "What do you want?" whichcrossed a "Where are you going?""To make a barricade," replied Courfeyrac."Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!""That's true, Aigle," said Courfeyrac.And at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Ruede la Chanvrerie.CHAPTER III--NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIREThe spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the streetwidened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocketwithout exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easilybarricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible exceptfrom the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full sight.Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. Therewas not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of aflash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of everydescription were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrifiedold woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-polesfor drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. Thewine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that themob had rushed into it.--"Ah my God! Ah my God!" sighed Mame Hucheloup.Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:--"Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatchgold."In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars hadbeen wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms ofstreet had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage,and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this draycontained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the pilesof paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widowHucheloup's empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly,with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, hadbacked up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks ofrough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procuredno one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn fromthe neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet andCourfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred witha rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of thepopulace for building everything that is built by demolishing.Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went andcame loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. Sheserved the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,made the passengers alight, offered his hand to "the ladies," dismissedthe conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by thebridle."Omnibuses," said he, "do not pass the Corinthe. Non licet omnibus adireCorinthum."An instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at theirwill, through the Rue Mondetour, and the omnibus lying on its sidecompleted the bar across the street.Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.Her eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she criedin a low tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from herthroat."The end of the world has come," she muttered.Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup's fat, red, wrinkled neck, andsaid to Grantaire: "My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman'sneck as an infinitely delicate thing."But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelotehad mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round herwaist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window."Matelote is homely!" he cried: "Matelote is of a dream of ugliness!Matelote is a chimaera. This is the secret of her birth: a GothicPygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love withone of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love togive it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She haschromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian's mistress, and she is a goodgirl. I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl containsa hero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at hermoustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! Shewill fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of thebanlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as thereare fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid;however, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me. Gentlemen, myfather always detested me because I could not understand mathematics.I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good fellow.Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and theresult is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, therewould have been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if thekind hearts only had fat purses, how much better things would go! Ipicture myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild's fortune! How much good hewould do! Matelote, embrace me! You are voluptuous and timid! You havecheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kissof a lover.""Hold your tongue, you cask!" said Courfeyrac.Grantaire retorted:--"I am the capitoul[52] and the master of the floral games!"Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand,raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, hadsomething of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He wouldhave perished at Thermopylae with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda withCromwell."Grantaire," he shouted, "go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhereelse than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness.Don't disgrace the barricade!"This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One wouldhave said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. Heseemed to be rendered suddenly sober.He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked atEnjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him:--"Let me sleep here.""Go and sleep somewhere else," cried Enjolras.But Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him,replied:--"Let me sleep here,--until I die."Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:--"Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, ofliving, and of dying."Grantaire replied in a grave tone:--"You will see."He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell heavilyon the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period ofinebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him, aninstant later he had fallen asleep.CHAPTER IV--AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUPBahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:--"Here's the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!"Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought toconsole the widowed proprietress."Mother Hucheloup, weren't you complaining the other day because youhad had a notice served on you for infringing the law, because Gibelotteshook a counterpane out of your window?""Yes, my good Monsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you goingto put that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for thecounterpane, and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the atticwindow into the street, that the government collected a fine of ahundred francs. If that isn't an abomination, what is!""Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you."Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefitwhich she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. Shewas satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having receiveda box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, andcried for vengeance, saying: "Father, you owe my husband affront foraffront." The father asked: "On which cheek did you receive the blow?""On the left cheek." The father slapped her right cheek and said: "Nowyou are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter'sears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife's."The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought undertheir blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles ofvitriol, two or three carnival torches, and a basket filled withfire-pots, "left over from the King's festival." This festival was veryrecent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that thesemunitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pepin.They smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie,the lantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and allthe lanterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondetour, du Cygne, desPrecheurs, and de la Grande and de la Petite-Truanderie.Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed everything. Two barricadeswere now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on theCorinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Ruede la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondetour, on the side ofthe Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, wasconstructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were about fiftyworkers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their way, they hadeffected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop.Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than thistroop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols,another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-hornslung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paperand was armed with a saddler's awl. There was one who was shouting:"Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of ourbayonet." This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat thecross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of thecartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted:Public Order. There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of thelegions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add tothis, all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, and bronzedlongshoremen. All were in haste; and as they helped each other, theydiscussed the possible chances. That they would receive succor aboutthree o'clock in the morning--that they were sure of one regiment, thatParis would rise. Terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort ofcordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they didnot know each other's names. Great perils have this fine characteristic,that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had beenlighted in the kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding intobullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware ofthe establishment. In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps andbuckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. Inthe billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variouslymodified by terror, which had stupefied one, rendered anotherbreathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths andmaking lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linenwith the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.The man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Enjolras hadobserved at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of theRue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was makinghimself useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for theyoung man who had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and whohad inquired for M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time whenthe omnibus had been overturned.Gavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to geteverything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted,whistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement ofall. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty; had he wings?yes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantlyvisible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he waseverywhere at once. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no haltwas possible with him. The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches.He troubled the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary,he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some,and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now prickinga student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again,hovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party toanother, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole company; a fly onthe immense revolutionary coach.Perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in hislittle lungs."Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are younow? A hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with! Your barricadeis very small. It must be carried up. Put everything on it, flingeverything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade isMother Gibou's tea. Hullo, here's a glass door."This elicited an exclamation from the workers."A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?""Hercules yourselves!" retorted Gavroche. "A glass door is an excellentthing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents theenemy taking it. So you've never prigged apples over a wall where therewere broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National Guardwhen they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherousthing. Well, you haven't a very wildly lively imagination, comrades."However, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one toanother, demanding: "A gun, I want a gun! Why don't you give me a gun?""Give you a gun!" said Combeferre."Come now!" said Gavroche, "why not? I had one in 1830 when we had adispute with Charles X."Enjolras shrugged his shoulders."When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children."Gavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered:--"If you are killed before me, I shall take yours.""Gamin!" said Enjolras."Greenhorn!" said Gavroche.A dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the streetcreated a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:--"Come with us, young fellow! well now, don't we do anything for this oldcountry of ours?"The dandy fled.CHAPTER V--PREPARATIONSThe journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnablestructure, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they callit, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is,that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It wasbuilt in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, eitherdisappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest bymeans of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each otherand arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the front of thebarricade, composed of piles of paving-stones and casks bound togetherby beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau's drayand of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been madebetween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade whichwas furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at thispoint. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up withropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over thebarricade.The little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building,was not visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt.Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the otherfragment of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des Precheursan issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possiblecommunication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear ofan attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue desPrecheurs.With the exception of this issue which was left free, and whichconstituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed abranch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on theRue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the wine-shopformed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, closed on allsides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grandbarrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street,so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses, allinhabited, but closed from top to bottom.All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour,and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap ora single bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who stillventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast aglance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, andredoubled their pace.The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table wasdragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table.Enjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. Thiscoffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, atremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.Each one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set aboutmaking others with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel ofpowder, it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held inreserve.The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it hadfinally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they nolonger paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drewnear, with melancholy undulations.They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, withsolemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside thebarricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue desPrecheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the gunsloaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtablestreets through which no one passed any longer, surrounded by thosedumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated,enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on,in the midst of that silence through which something could be feltadvancing, and which had about it something tragic and terrifying,isolated, armed, determined, and tranquil.CHAPTER VI--WAITINGDuring those hours of waiting, what did they do?We must needs tell, since this is a matter of history.While the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepanof melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over aglowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on thebarricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept aneye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out andunited as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in theirstudent life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which had beenconverted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubtwhich they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed restingagainst the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close toa supreme hour, began to recite love verses.What verses? These:--               Vous rappelez-vous notre douce vie,                 Lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux,               Et que nous n'avions au coeur d'autre envie                 Que d'etre bien mis et d'etre amoureux,               Lorsqu'en ajoutant votre age a mon age,                 Nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans,               Et que, dans notre humble et petit menage,                 Tout, meme l'hiver, nous etait printemps?               Beaux jours! Manuel etait fier et sage,                 Paris s'asseyait a de saints banquets,               Foy lancait la foudre, et votre corsage                 Avait une epingle ou je me piquais.               Tout vous contemplait. Avocat sans causes,                 Quand je vous menais au Prado diner,               Vous etiez jolie au point que les roses                 Me faisaient l'effet de se retourner.               Je les entendais dire: Est elle belle!                 Comme elle sent bon!  Quels cheveux a flots!               Sous son mantelet elle cache une aile,                 Son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos.               J'errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple.                 Les passants crovaient que l'amour charme               Avait marie, dans notre heureux couple,                 Le doux mois d'avril au beau mois de mai.               Nous vivions caches, contents, porte close,                 Devorant l'amour, bon fruit defendu,               Ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose                 Que deja ton coeur avait repondu.               La Sorbonne etait l'endroit bucolique                 Ou je t'adorais du soir au matin.               C'est ainsi qu'une ame amoureuse applique                 La carte du Tendre au pays Latin.               O place Maubert! o place Dauphine!                 Quand, dans le taudis frais et printanier,               Tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine,                 Je voyais un astre au fond du grenier.               J'ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m'en reste;                 Mieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais,               Tu me demontrais la bonte celeste                 Avec une fleur que tu me donnais.               Je t'obeissais, tu m' etais soumise;                 O grenier dore! te lacer! te voir               Aller et venir des l'aube en chemise,                 Mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir.               Et qui done pourrait perde la memoire                 De ces temps d'aurore et de firmament,               De rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire,                 Ou l'amour begaye un argot charmant?               Nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe;                 Tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon;               Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe,                 Et je te donnais le tasse en japon.               Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire!                 Ton manchon brule, ton boa perdu!               Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare                 Qu'un soir pour souper nons avons vendu!               J'etais mendiant et toi charitable.                 Je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds.               Dante in folio nous servait de table                 Pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons.               La premiere fois qu'en mon joyeux bouge                 Je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu,               Quand tu t'en allais decoiffee et rouge,                 Je restai tout pale et je crus en Dieu!               Te rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre,                 Et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons?               Oh que de soupirs, de nos coeurs pleins d'ombre,                 Se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds![53]The hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few starswhich began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those desertedstreets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was inpreparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a lowtone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentlepoet.In the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and inthe large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be met with onShrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, on their wayto la Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, came from theFaubourg Saint-Antoine.The torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving-stones closed onthree sides to shelter it from the wind, and disposed in such a fashionthat all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricaderemained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flagformidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern.This light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable andterrible purple.CHAPTER VII--THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTESNight was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heardwas confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare,badly sustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged,was a sign that the Government was taking its time, and collecting itsforces. These fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong soulson the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche,who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious lightof two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account ofthe powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast nogleam outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have anylight in the upper stories.Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely withhis cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just enteredthe tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the leastlighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held itbetween his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment, distractedby a hundred "amusing" things, had not even seen this man.When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the streeturchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up tothat moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in thebarricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but,from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sortof brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on.The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to step aroundhim on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one isafraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish countenance whichwas, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and so profound, sogay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man whichsignify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can thisbe? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on hisheels, clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like abird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. Hewas astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had themien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering aVenus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizinga Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the instinctwhich scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evidentthat a great event had happened in Gavroche's life.It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolrasaccosted him."You are small," said Enjolras, "you will not be seen. Go out of thebarricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in thestreets, and come back and tell me what is going on."Gavroche raised himself on his haunches."So the little chaps are good for something! that's very lucky! I'llgo! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the bigones." And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added,as he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: "Do you see that bigfellow there?""Well?""He's a police spy.""Are you sure of it?""It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the PortRoyal, where I was taking the air, by my ear."Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a verylow tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand.The man left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied bythree others. The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, wentand placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention,behind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaningwith his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:--"Who are you?"At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep intoEnjolras' clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning. Hesmiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic,and more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughtygravity:--"I see what it is. Well, yes!""You are a police spy?""I am an agent of the authorities.""And your name?""Javert."Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, beforeJavert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, pinionedand searched.They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces ofglass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and withthis motto: Supervision and vigilance, and on the other this note:"JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two," and the signature of thePrefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained severalgold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch,at the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope,which Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, writtenin the very hand of the Prefect of Police:--"As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javertwill make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that themalefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine,near the Jena bridge."The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behindhis back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of theroom which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approvedof everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert andsaid to him:--"It's the mouse who has caught the cat."All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those aboutthe wine-shop noticed it.Javert had not uttered a single cry.At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came runningup.Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that hecould not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity ofthe man who has never lied."He is a police spy," said Enjolras.And turning to Javert: "You will be shot ten minutes before thebarricade is taken."Javert replied in his most imperious tone:--"Why not at once?""We are saving our powder.""Then finish the business with a blow from a knife.""Spy," said the handsome Enjolras, "we are judges and not assassins."Then he called Gavroche:--"Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!""I'm going!" cried Gavroche.And halting as he was on the point of setting out:--"By the way, you will give me his gun!" and he added: "I leave you themusician, but I want the clarionet."The gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the openingin the large barricade.CHAPTER VIII--MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LECABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUCThe tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, thereader would not see those grand moments of social birth-pangs in arevolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort,in their exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch hereoutlined, an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurredalmost immediately after Gavroche's departure.Mobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as theyroll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each otherwhence they come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led byEnjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearingthe jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on theshoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of adrunken savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and whowas, moreover, an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him,was very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seatedhimself with several others at a table which they had dragged outsideof the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him drunkseemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at theextremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the wholestreet and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:--"Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire.When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advanceinto the street!""Yes, but the house is closed," said one of the drinkers."Let us knock!""They will not open.""Let us break in the door!"Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and knocks.The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A thirdstroke. The same silence."Is there any one here?" shouts Cabuc.Nothing stirs.Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely ofoak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuineprison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the housetremble, but did not shake the door.Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for atiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and atthis aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-hairedold man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.The man who was knocking paused."Gentlemen," said the porter, "what do you want?""Open!" said Cabuc."That cannot be, gentlemen.""Open, nevertheless.""Impossible, gentlemen."Le Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, andas it was very dark, the porter did not see him."Will you open, yes or no?""No, gentlemen.""Do you say no?""I say no, my goo--"The porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered underhis chin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing thejugular vein.The old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and wasextinguished, and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless headlying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke whichfloated off towards the roof."There!" said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to thepavement.He had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on hisshoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon, and he heard a voicesaying to him:--"On your knees."The murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras' cold, white face.Enjolras held a pistol in his hand.He had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.He had seized Cabuc's collar, blouse, shirt, and suspender with his lefthand."On your knees!" he repeated.And, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bentthe thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his kneesin the mire.Le Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by asuperhuman hand.Enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman'sface, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis.His dilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greekprofile that expression of wrath and that expression of Chastity which,as the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice.The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circleat a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in thepresence of the thing which they were about to behold.Le Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in everylimb.Enjolras released him and drew out his watch."Collect yourself," said he. "Think or pray. You have one minute.""Mercy!" murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered afew inarticulate oaths.Enjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass,then he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabucby the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees andshrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of thoseintrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible ofadventures, turned aside their heads.An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement facedownwards.Enjolras straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe glancearound him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:--"Throw that outside."Three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was stillagitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled,and flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondetour.Enjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose shadowsslowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once he raised hisvoice.A silence fell upon them."Citizens," said Enjolras, "what that man did is frightful, what I havedone is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,because insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is evenmore of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of theRevolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims ofduty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have, therefore,tried that man, and condemned him to death. As for myself, constrainedas I am to do what I have done, and yet abhorring it, I have judgedmyself also, and you shall soon see to what I have condemned myself."Those who listened to him shuddered."We will share thy fate," cried Combeferre."So be it," replied Enjolras. "One word more. In executing this man,I have obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,necessity's name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monstersshall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish beforeFraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, Ido pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, Imake use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there willbe neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, norbloody retaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will be nomore Michael. In the future no one will kill any one else, the earthwill beam with radiance, the human race will love. The day will come,citizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life; itwill come, and it is in order that it may come that we are about todie."Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some timestanding on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. Hisstaring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other's hands silently, and,leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watchedwith an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave youngman, executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and alsoof rock.Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies weretaken to the morgue and searched, a police agent's card was found on LeCabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the specialreport on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, whichis strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The factis, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer anyquestion of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of hisdisappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with theinvisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.The whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotionof that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quicklyterminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the smallyoung man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.This lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join theinsurgents.BOOK THIRTEENTH.--MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOWCHAPTER I--FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENISThe voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to thebarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effectof the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presenteditself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darknessoffered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in thegloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar whichhad so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: "Iwill go."Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in hisbrain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after thosetwo months passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed atonce by all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining, tomake a speedy end of all.He set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, as hehad Javert's pistols with him.The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, hadvanished from his sight in the street.Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversedthe Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs Elysees, thePlace Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were openthere, the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making theirpurchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Cafe Laiter,and nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook's shop. Only a fewposting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel des Princesand the Hotel Meurice.Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme. Therethe shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of theirhalf-open doors, people were walking about, the street lanterns werelighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted asusual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honore. In proportion as he left thePalais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shopswere fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grewsombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For thepassers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could be seen to speak inthis throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were "assemblages", motionlessand gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in themidst of running water.At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked.It formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrableblock of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones.There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks,blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitudeundulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had thehoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, adull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion ofthe throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in theextension of the Rue Saint-Honore, there was no longer a single windowin which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rowsof lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. Thelanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, andshed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider.These streets were not deserted. There could be descried piles of guns,moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious observer passed thatlimit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and the armybegan.Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had beensummoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and topass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided thesentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Bethisy, and directedhis course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais,there were no longer any lanterns.After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits ofthe troops; he found himself in something startling. There was no longera passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was no one;solitude, silence, night, I know not what chill which seized hold uponone. Entering a street was like entering a cellar.He continued to advance.He took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it aman? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It hadpassed and vanished.Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judgedto be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came incontact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturnedwagon; his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stonesscattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of thebarrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself alongthe walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to himthat he could make out something white in front of him. He approached,it took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of the omnibusharnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random allday from street to street, and had finally halted there, with the wearypatience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than manunderstands the actions of Providence.Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street whichseemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no oneknows whence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close byhim, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above hishead over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was stillto be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of thepillars of the market.This shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encounterednothing more.The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.Nevertheless, Marius pressed forward.CHAPTER II--AN OWL'S VIEW OF PARISA being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing ofthe bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within acity, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where athousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made theirredoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark andenormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glancefell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closedwindows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased.The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere,and maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary tactics ofinsurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiplyevery combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. Atdusk, every window where a candle was burning received a shot. The lightwas extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing wasstirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses;and in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows ofwindows and stores, the indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs,and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddypavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at that mass of shadowsmight, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at intervals,of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines, andprofiles of singular buildings, something like the lights which go andcome in ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated.The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal, abovewhich, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower ofSaint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of thosegrand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarterswhere the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where afew street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might havedistinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumbleof artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks wereswelling from minute to minute; a formidable girdle which was slowlydrawing in and around the insurrection.The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrouscavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as wehave just seen, any street which one might come to offered nothing butdarkness.A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks,into which it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible toremain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited,where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming. Invisiblecombatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; snares of thesepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was over. No morelight was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the lightning of guns,no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death.Where? How? When? No one knew, but it was certain and inevitable. Inthis place which had been marked out for the struggle, the Governmentand the insurrection, the National Guard, and popular societies, thebourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, were about to come intocontact. The necessity was the same for both. The only possible issuethenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors. A situation soextreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the most timid felt themselvesseized with resolution, and the most daring with terror.Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination wereequal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed ofretreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed offlight.It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, thattriumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection shouldprove itself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government understood thisas well as the parties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hencea thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of thisquarter where all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubledanxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point ofemerging. Here only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rendingas the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin ofSaint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor ofthat wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.As it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord with whatmen were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect.The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with theirmelancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though animmense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb.While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in thesame locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events,while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name ofprinciples, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, wereapproaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping andthrowing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last anddecisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatalquarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities ofthat wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happyand opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard givingutterance to a dull roar.A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the bruteand of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns thewise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and fromon high like the voice of the thunder.CHAPTER III--THE EXTREME EDGEMarius had reached the Halles.There everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless thanin the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial peaceof the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over theheavens.Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background thelofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie onthe Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which wasburning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towardsthat red light. It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees, and hecaught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Precheurs. He enteredit. The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did notsee him. He felt that he was very close to that which he had come insearch of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbowof that short section of the Rue Mondetour which was, as the reader willremember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with theoutside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrusthis head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondetour.A little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie whichcast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed,he perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, andbeyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, and mencrouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten fathomsdistant from him. It was the interior of the barricade.The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest ofthe wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.Marius had but a step more to take.Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms,and fell to thinking about his father.He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud asoldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, andhad touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, whohad left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of thatsame blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown graybefore his time in discipline and command, who had lived with hissword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockadeblackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks,in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration oftwenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, asmiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having doneeverything for France and nothing against her.He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour hadstruck, that following his father, he too was about to show himselfbrave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breastto bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, thathe was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle,and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was thestreet, and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war!He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this hewas about to fall. Then he shuddered.He thought of his father's sword, which his grandfather had sold to asecond-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said tohimself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape fromhim, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus fled, itwas because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future;that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of thegutters, the war of the pavements, fusillades through cellar-windows,blows given and received in the rear; it was because, coming fromMarengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de laChanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the father, itdid not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that swordwere there, if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow,he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darknessbetween Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched hishands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword of the angel!He told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and thatit had disappeared, that that was well, that that was just, that hisgrandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory, and thatit was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction,sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old junk, than that itshould, to-day, wound the side of his country.And then he fell to weeping bitterly.This was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he couldnot. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her hisword of honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meantthat it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear thatshe no longer loved him, since she had departed thus without warning,without a word, without a letter, although she knew his address! Whatwas the good of living, and why should he live now? And then, what!should he retreat after going so far? should he flee from danger afterhaving approached it? should he slip away after having come and peepedinto the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: "After all, Ihave had enough of it as it is. I have seen it, that suffices, this iscivil war, and I shall take my leave!" Should he abandon his friends whowere expecting him? Who were in need of him possibly! who were a merehandful against an army! Should he be untrue at once to his love, tocountry, to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext ofpatriotism? But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his fatherwas there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him onthe loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him: "March on, youpoltroon!"Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped hishead.All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just beeneffected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought whichis peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly tobe near death. The vision of the action into which he felt that hewas, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no moreas lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenlytransfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before theeye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points of reveryrecurred to him in throngs, but without troubling him. He left none ofthem unanswered.Let us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not caseswhere insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that wasdegrading for the son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was aboutto begin? It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is somethingquite different. The question is no longer one of sacred territory,--butof a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds.But is it true that the country does wail? France bleeds, but libertysmiles; and in the presence of liberty's smile, France forgets herwound. And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point ofview, why do we speak of civil war?Civil war--what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all warbetween men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object.There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just andunjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded,war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is hasteningon against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be necessary.What have we to reproach that war with? War does not become a disgrace,the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used forassassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Thenwar, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime.Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right doesone form of man despise another? By what right should the sword ofWashington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against thestranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one isthe defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand every appealto arms within a city's limits without taking the object into aconsideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould vonBlankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? Thatwas the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. ButAmbiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix againstSpain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, themonarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right divine isa stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violatesthe geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out theEnglish, in both cases, regaining possession of one's own territory.There comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; afterphilosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the ideahas sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; theencyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them.After AEschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes havea tendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy.A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must be stirred up,pushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance,their eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at themin terrible handfuls. They must be a little thunderstruck themselves attheir own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessityof tocsins and wars. Great combatants must rise, must enlighten nationswith audacity, and shake up that sad humanity which is coveredwith gloom by the right divine, Caesarian glory, force, fanaticism,irresponsible power, and absolute majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied inthe contemplation, in their twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphsof the night. Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you speaking? Do youcall Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. Both of themare what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but principlesare not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, thepeculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no concessions,then; all encroachments on man should be repressed. There is a divineright in Louis XVI., there is because a Bourbon in Louis Philippe; bothrepresent in a certain measure the confiscation of right, and, in orderto clear away universal insurrection, they must be combated; it mustbe done, France being always the one to begin. When the master fallsin France, he falls everywhere. In short, what cause is more just, andconsequently, what war is greater, than that which re-establishessocial truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people to thepeople, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head ofFrance, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses everygerm of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates theobstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord,and places the human race once more on a level with the right? Thesewars build up peace. An enormous fortress of prejudices, privileges,superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences, iniquities, anddarkness still stands erect in this world, with its towers of hatred.It must be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made to crumble. Toconquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.There is no one who has not noticed it in his own case--the soul,--andtherein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, hasa strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violentextremities, and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profounddespair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat subjectsand discuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the threadof the syllogism floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm ofthought. This was the situation of Marius' mind.As he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in everydirection, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, hisglance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgentswere here conversing in a low voice, without moving, and therewas perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage ofexpectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third story Mariusdescried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularlyattentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below,by the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones,this head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, inthat sombre and uncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless, astonishedface, with its bristling hair, its eyes fixed and staring, and itsyawning mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity. Onewould have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who wereabout to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head,descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the firstfloor, where it stopped.BOOK FOURTEENTH.--THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR[Illustration: The Grandeurs of Despair 4b-14-1-despair]CHAPTER I--THE FLAG: ACT FIRSTAs yet, nothing had come. Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry.Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines inhand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressedeach other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and mostdistant sound of marching.Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice,which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to singdistinctly, to the old popular air of "By the Light of the Moon," thisbit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:--               Mon nez est en larmes,               Mon ami Bugeaud,               Prete moi tes gendarmes               Pour leur dire un mot.                  En capote bleue,                  La poule au shako,                  Voici la banlieue!                  Co-cocorico![54]They pressed each other's hands."That is Gavroche," said Enjolras."He is warning us," said Combeferre.A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being moreagile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into thebarricade, all breathless, saying:--"My gun! Here they are!"An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound ofhands seeking their guns became audible."Would you like my carbine?" said Enjolras to the lad."I want a big gun," replied Gavroche.And he seized Javert's gun.Two sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same momentas Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and thevidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane desPrecheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that nothing wasapproaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles.The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimlyvisible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offeredto the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into asmoke.Each man had taken up his position for the conflict.Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre,Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling insidethe large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of thebarrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones asthough at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commandedby Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled at theirshoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe.Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy,and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu.This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous,approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a tranquiland terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was thatcombined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but thisstony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about itwhich awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the ideaof a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marchingonward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. Itseemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end ofthe street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of thatdense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallicthreads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved aboutlike those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneathone's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the momentwhen one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrelsconfusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch.A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from thedepths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, sinceno one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking,shouted:--"Who goes there?"At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position,was heard.Enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:--"The French Revolution!""Fire!" shouted the voice.A flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of afurnace had been flung open, and hastily closed again.A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell.The discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut thestaff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole.Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetratedthe barricade and wounded several men.The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The attackhad been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest.It was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the veryleast."Comrades!" shouted Courfeyrac, "let us not waste our powder. Let uswait until they are in the street before replying.""And, above all," said Enjolras, "let us raise the flag again."He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; thetroops were re-loading their arms.Enjolras went on:--"Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on thebarricade again?"Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,without any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simplydeath. The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation. Enjolrashimself felt a thrill. He repeated:--"Does no one volunteer?"CHAPTER II--THE FLAG: ACT SECONDSince they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction ofthe barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeufhad not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground-floor of thewine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so tospeak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to think.Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning himof his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them.When they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he werereplying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed, his lips becamemotionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive.Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed anattitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists plantedon his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over aprecipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it didnot seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had goneto take up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-roomwhere Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a nakedsword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of theattack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached him and had,as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed the room,and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: "Does no onevolunteer?" the old man was seen to make his appearance on the thresholdof the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion in thedifferent groups. A shout went up:--"It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is therepresentative of the people!"It is probable that he did not hear them.He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before himwith a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled inamazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, thisold man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly toascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade. Thiswas so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: "Off with yourhats!" At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful spectacle; hiswhite locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and wrinkled brow,his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rosethrough the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch,and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of '93 emergingfrom the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.When he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terriblephantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundredinvisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as thoughhe were more powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid thedarkness, a supernatural and colossal form.There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence ofprodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flagand shouted:--"Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity! Equality!and Death!"Those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmurof a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably thecommissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other endof the street.Then the same piercing voice which had shouted: "Who goes there?"shouted:--"Retire!"M. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame ofaberration, raised the flag above his head and repeated:--"Long live the Republic!""Fire!" said the voice.A second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon thebarricade.The old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flagand fell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, withoutstretched arms.Rivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale and sad,seemed to be gazing at the sky.One of those emotions which are superior to man, which make him forgeteven to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, and they approachedthe body with respectful awe."What men these regicides were!" said Enjolras.Courfeyrac bent down to Enjolras' ear:--"This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm. Butthis man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. His name wasFather Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day. But hewas a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.""The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus," replied Enjolras.Then he raised his voice:--"Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. Wehesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is whatthose who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear!This aged man is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a longlife and a magnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover,that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would hisfather living, and may his presence in our midst render the barricadeimpregnable!"A murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.Enjolras bent down, raised the old man's head, and fierce as he was, hekissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling thisdead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, heremoved his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:--"This is our flag now."CHAPTER III--GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS' CARBINEThey threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup's over Father Mabeuf.Six men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, andbore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large table inthe tap-room.These men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which theywere engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation in which theystood.When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, Enjolrassaid to the spy:--"It will be your turn presently!"During all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had not quitted hispost, but had remained on guard, thought he espied some men stealthilyapproaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:--"Look out!"Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel,Bossuet, and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It wasalmost too late. They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulatingabove the barricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were makingtheir way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut,thrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.The moment was critical. It was that first, redoubtable moment ofinundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when thewater begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more andthe barricade would have been taken.Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, andkilled him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second killedBahorel with a blow from his bayonet. Another had already overthrownCourfeyrac, who was shouting: "Follow me!" The largest of all, a sort ofcolossus, marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed. The urchin took inhis arms Javert's immense gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, andfired. No discharge followed. Javert's gun was not loaded. The municipalguard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child.Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from thesoldier's grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in thecentre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bulletstruck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, andlaid him low on the pavement.This was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.CHAPTER IV--THE BARREL OF POWDERMarius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondetour, had witnessed,shuddering and irresolute, the first phase of the combat. But he had notlong been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which maybe designated as the call of the abyss. In the presence of the imminenceof the peril, in the presence of the death of M. Mabeuf, that melancholyenigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed, and Courfeyrac shouting:"Follow me!" of that child threatened, of his friends to succor or toavenge, all hesitation had vanished, and he had flung himself into theconflict, his two pistols in hand. With his first shot he had savedGavroche, and with the second delivered Courfeyrac.Amid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards,the assailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit MunicipalGuards, soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs couldnow be seen, gun in hand, rearing themselves to more than half theheight of their bodies.They already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, but they didnot leap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of sometrap. They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion'sden. The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets, theirbear-skin caps, and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces.Marius had no longer any weapons; he had flung away his dischargedpistols after firing them; but he had caught sight of the barrel ofpowder in the tap-room, near the door.As he turned half round, gazing in that direction, a soldier took aim athim. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was laidon the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some onewho had darted forward,--the young workman in velvet trousers. The shotsped, traversed the hand and possibly, also, the workman, since he fell,but the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was rather to beapprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering thetap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in a confused way, perceivedthat gun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked it, and hehad heard the discharge. But in moments like this, the things which onesees vacillate and are precipitated, and one pauses for nothing. Onefeels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still, and all is cloud.The insurgents, surprised but not terrified, had rallied. Enjolras hadshouted: "Wait! Don't fire at random!" In the first confusion, theymight, in fact, wound each other. The majority of them had ascendedto the window on the first story and to the attic windows, whence theycommanded the assailants.The most determined, with Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, andCombeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs against thehouses at the rear, unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers andguards who crowned the barricade.All this was accomplished without haste, with that strange andthreatening gravity which precedes engagements. They took aim, pointblank, on both sides: they were so close that they could talk togetherwithout raising their voices.When they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink ofdarting forth, an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said:--"Lay down your arms!""Fire!" replied Enjolras.The two discharges took place at the same moment, and all disappeared insmoke.An acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak,dull groans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sidescould be seen to be thinned out, but still in the same positions,reloading in silence. All at once, a thundering voice was heard,shouting:--"Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!"All turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded.Marius had entered the tap-room, and had seized the barrel of powder,then he had taken advantage of the smoke, and the sort of obscure mistwhich filled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade asfar as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. To tearit from the torch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, to thrust thepile of stones under the barrel, which was instantly staved in, witha sort of horrible obedience,--all this had cost Marius but the timenecessary to stoop and rise again; and now all, National Guards,Municipal Guards, officers, soldiers, huddled at the other extremity ofthe barricade, gazed stupidly at him, as he stood with his foot on thestones, his torch in his hand, his haughty face illuminated by a fatalresolution, drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtablepile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder, and givingvent to that startling cry:--"Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!"Marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of theyoung revolution after the apparition of the old."Blow up the barricade!" said a sergeant, "and yourself with it!"Marius retorted: "And myself also."And he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder.But there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants,abandoning their dead and wounded, flowed back pell-mell and in disordertowards the extremity of the street, and there were again lost in thenight. It was a headlong flight.The barricade was free.CHAPTER V--END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIREAll flocked around Marius. Courfeyrac flung himself on his neck."Here you are!""What luck!" said Combeferre."You came in opportunely!" ejaculated Bossuet."If it had not been for you, I should have been dead!" began Courfeyracagain."If it had not been for you, I should have been gobbled up!" addedGavroche.Marius asked:--"Where is the chief?""You are he!" said Enjolras.Marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long; now it was awhirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him theeffect of being outside of him and of bearing him away. It seemed to himthat he was already at an immense distance from life. His two luminousmonths of joy and love, ending abruptly at that frightful precipice,Cosette lost to him, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting himself killedfor the Republic, himself the leader of the insurgents,--all thesethings appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare. He was obliged tomake a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him wasreal. Marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothingis more imminent than the impossible, and that what it is alwaysnecessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He had looked on at his owndrama as a piece which one does not understand.In the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert,who, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during thewhole of the attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revoltseething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty ofa judge. Marius had not even seen him.In the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heardmarching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did notventure into it, either because they were awaiting orders or becausethey were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh onthis impregnable redoubt. The insurgents had posted sentinels, and someof them, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception ofthe two tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one onwhich lay Father Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and hadreplaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of thewidow Hucheloup and her servants. On these mattresses they had laid thewounded. As for the three poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe, no oneknew what had become of them. They were finally found, however, hiddenin the cellar.A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.The roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who wasit? One of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. Hewas sought among the wounded, he was not there. He was sought among thedead, he was not there. He was evidently a prisoner. Combeferre said toEnjolras:--"They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set on the death ofthat spy?""Yes," replied Enjolras; "but less so than on the life of JeanProuvaire."This took place in the tap-room near Javert's post."Well," resumed Combeferre, "I am going to fasten my handkerchief tomy cane, and go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man fortheirs.""Listen," said Enjolras, laying his hand on Combeferre's arm.At the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms.They heard a manly voice shout:--"Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!"They recognized the voice of Prouvaire.A flash passed, a report rang out.Silence fell again."They have killed him," exclaimed Combeferre.Enjolras glanced at Javert, and said to him:--"Your friends have just shot you."CHAPTER VI--THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFEA peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of thebarricades is almost always made from the front, and that the assailantsgenerally abstain from turning the position, either because theyfear ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting entangled in thetortuous streets. The insurgents' whole attention had been directed,therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot alwaysmenaced, and there the struggle would infallibly recommence. But Mariusthought of the little barricade, and went thither. It was deserted andguarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones.Moreover, the Mondetour alley, and the branches of the Rue de la PetiteTruanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm.As Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard hisname pronounced feebly in the darkness."Monsieur Marius!"He started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him twohours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet.Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.He looked about him, but saw no one.Marius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added byhis mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing aroundhim. He advanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where thebarricade lay."Monsieur Marius!" repeated the voice.This time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he lookedand saw nothing."At your feet," said the voice.He bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itselftowards him.It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him.The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers ofcoarse velvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of blood.Marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards himand which was saying to him:--"You do not recognize me?""No.""Eponine."Marius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She wasdressed in men's clothes."How come you here? What are you doing here?""I am dying," said she.There are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius criedout with a start:--"You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attendto you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order notto hurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did you comehither?"And he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her.She uttered a feeble cry."Have I hurt you?" asked Marius."A little.""But I only touched your hand."She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius sawa black hole."What is the matter with your hand?" said he."It is pierced.""Pierced?""Yes.""What with?""A bullet.""How?""Did you see a gun aimed at you?""Yes, and a hand stopping it.""It was mine."Marius was seized with a shudder."What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it isnothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one doesnot die of a pierced hand."She murmured:--"The bullet traversed my hand, but it came out through my back. It isuseless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you can carefor me better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on this stone."He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius' knees, and, without looking athim, she said:--"Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no longersuffer."She remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with aneffort, and looked at Marius."Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you enteredthat garden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house;and then, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you--"She paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedlyexisted in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:--"You thought me ugly, didn't you?"She continued:--"You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It wasI who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that.And yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzleof the gun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die beforeyou. When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one sawme, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: 'So he is notcoming!' Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I amwell. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when Ilooked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on theboulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long timeago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: 'I don't want yourmoney.' I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did notthink to tell you to pick it up. The sun was shining bright, and it wasnot cold. Do you remember, Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Everyone is going to die."She had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosedher bare throat.As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where therewas another hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment astream of blood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole.Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion."Oh!" she resumed, "it is coming again, I am stifling!"She caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on thepavement.At that moment the young cock's crow executed by little Gavrocheresounded through the barricade.The child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly thesong then so popular:--   "En voyant Lafayette,             "On beholding Lafayette,    Le gendarme repete:--             The gendarme repeats:--    Sauvons nous! sauvons nous!       Let us flee! let us flee!          sauvons nous!"                     let us flee!Eponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:--"It is he."And turning to Marius:--"My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me.""Your brother?" inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitterand sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thenardiers whichhis father had bequeathed to him; "who is your brother?""That little fellow.""The one who is singing?""Yes."Marius made a movement."Oh! don't go away," said she, "it will not be long now."She was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken byhiccoughs.At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as nearthat of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:--"Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my pocketfor you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want tohave it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when wemeet again presently? Take your letter."She grasped Marius' hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she nolonger seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius' hand in the pocketof her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper."Take it," said she.Marius took the letter.She made a sign of satisfaction and contentment."Now, for my trouble, promise me--"And she stopped."What?" asked Marius."Promise me!""I promise.""Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.--I shall feel it."She dropped her head again on Marius' knees, and her eyelids closed. Hethought the poor soul had departed. Eponine remained motionless. Allat once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, sheslowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death,and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed fromanother world:--"And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit inlove with you."She tried to smile once more and expired.CHAPTER VII--GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCESMarius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where theicy perspiration stood in beads.This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive farewellto an unhappy soul.It was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Eponinehad given him. He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight.He was impatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that theunhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think ofunfolding this paper.He laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him thathe could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, foldedand sealed with a woman's elegant care. The address was in a woman'shand and ran:--"To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac's, Rue de laVerrerie, No. 16."He broke the seal and read:-- "My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. In a week we shall be in England.  COSETTE.  June 4th."Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even acquaintedwith Cosette's handwriting.What had taken place may be related in a few words. Eponine had beenthe cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she hadcherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and theruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius andCosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she cameacross who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Eponinedisguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to JeanValjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: "Leave your house."Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to Cosette:"We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme Arme withToussaint. Next week, we shall be in London." Cosette, utterlyoverwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple oflines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? Shenever went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission,would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma,Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine in man's clothes,who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to"this young workman" and had handed him five francs and the letter,saying: "Carry this letter immediately to its address." Eponine had putthe letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she wentto Courfeyrac's quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose ofdelivering the letter, but,--a thing which every jealous and loving soulwill comprehend,--"to see." There she had waited for Marius, or at leastfor Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of seeing. When Courfeyrac hadtold her: "We are going to the barricades," an idea flashed through hermind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into anyother, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process ofconstruction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning,and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk tohis trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the RuePlumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of hisfriends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade.She reckoned on Marius' despair when he should fail to find Cosette; shewas not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself.What she did there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragicjoy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death,and who say: "No one shall have him!"Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses. So she loved him! For onemoment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Thenhe said to himself: "She is going away. Her father is taking her toEngland, and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage. Nothingis changed in our fates." Dreamers like Marius are subject to supremeattacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigueof living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then he reflectedthat he had still two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette of hisdeath and send her a final farewell, and to save from the impendingcatastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child, Eponine's brotherand Thenardier's son.He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had containedthe note-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love forCosette. He tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:--"Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I haveno fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no longerthere. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it. Idie. I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, andthou wilt smile."Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself withfolding the paper in four, and added the address:--"To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent's, Rue del'Homme Arme, No. 7."Having folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew outhis pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil, thesefour lines on the first page:--"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais."He put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.The gamin, at the sound of Marius' voice, ran up to him with his merryand devoted air."Will you do something for me?""Anything," said Gavroche. "Good God! if it had not been for you, Ishould have been done for.""Do you see this letter?""Yes.""Take it. Leave the barricade instantly" (Gavroche began to scratch hisear uneasily) "and to-morrow morning, you will deliver it at its addressto Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent's, Rue de l'Homme Arme, No.7."The heroic child replied"Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shallnot be there.""The barricade will not be attacked until daybreak, according to allappearances, and will not be taken before to-morrow noon."The fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricadehad, in fact, been prolonged. It was one of those intermissions whichfrequently occur in nocturnal combats, which are always followed by anincrease of rage."Well," said Gavroche, "what if I were to go and carry your letterto-morrow?""It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, allthe streets will be guarded, and you will not be able to get out. Go atonce."Gavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there in indecision,scratching his ear sadly.All at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movementswhich were common with him."All right," said he.And he started off at a run through Mondetour lane.An idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to a decision,but he had not mentioned it for fear that Marius might offer someobjection to it.This was the idea:--"It is barely midnight, the Rue de l'Homme Arme is not far off; I willgo and deliver the letter at once, and I shall get back in time."BOOK FIFTEENTH.--THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARMECHAPTER I--A DRINKER IS A BABBLERWhat are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrectionsof the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjeanat that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort ofgulf had opened again within him. He also was trembling, like Paris,on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hourshad sufficed to bring this about. His destiny and his conscience hadsuddenly been covered with gloom. Of him also, as well as of Paris, itmight have been said: "Two principles are face to face. The white angeland the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of theabyss. Which of the two will hurl the other over? Who will carry theday?"On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean,accompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue del'Homme Arme. A change awaited him there.Cosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort atresistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side,Cosette's will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct,and had been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There hadbeen objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abruptadvice: "Leave your house," hurled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, hadalarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. He thought thathe had been traced and followed. Cosette had been obliged to give way.Both had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme without opening their lips,and without uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personalpreoccupation; Jean Valjean so uneasy that he did not notice Cosette'ssadness, Cosette so sad that she did not notice Jean Valjean'suneasiness.Jean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had neverdone in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of notreturning to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behindnor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was devoted andtrustworthy. Treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity.Now Toussaint, as though she had been destined to be Jean Valjean'sservant, was not curious. She stammered in her peasant dialect ofBarneville: "I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine."In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight,Jean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise,baptized by Cosette "the inseparable." Full trunks would have requiredporters, and porters are witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to thedoor on the Rue de Babylone, and they had taken their departure.It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack upa little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had takenonly her portfolio and her blotting-book.Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery ofthis departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet onlyat dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to write her note to Marius.They had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme after night had fullyfallen.They had gone to bed in silence.The lodgings in the Rue de l'Homme Arme were situated on a backcourt, on the second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, adining-room and a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garretwhere there was a folding-bed, and which fell to Toussaint's share. Thedining-room was an antechamber as well, and separated the two bedrooms.The apartment was provided with all necessary utensils.People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human natureis so constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'HommeArme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. Thereare soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind.An obscure street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced anindescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris,which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transversebeam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of theclamorous city, dimly lighted at mid-day, and is, so to speak, incapableof emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which holdtheir peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnantoblivion in that street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there.How could he be found there?His first care was to place the inseparable beside him.He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On thefollowing morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought thedining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old roundtable, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a dilapidatedarm-chair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered withToussaint's packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean's uniform ofa National Guard was visible through a rent.As for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, anddid not make her appearance until evening.About five o'clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busyingherself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache,had bade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber.Jean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, andwith his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered his serenity,had regained possession of his sense of security.While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,noticed in a confused way, Toussaint's stammering words as she saidto him: "Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting inParis." But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid noheed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and beganto pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,growing ever more serene.With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. Notthat he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a younggirl's fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be nothing leftof it in a day or two; but he meditated on the future, and, as was hishabit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he saw no obstacle totheir happy life resuming its course. At certain hours, everything seemsimpossible, at others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in themidst of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the badones, as day follows night, by virtue of that law of succession andof contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, and whichsuperficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where he hadtaken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had been troubling himfor some time past. This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, madehim begin to perceive a little azure. To have quitted the RuePlumet without complications or incidents was one good step alreadyaccomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if only for a fewmonths, and to set out for London. Well, they would go. What differencedid it make to him whether he was in France or in England, provided hehad Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation. Cosette sufficed forhis happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not suffice for Cosette'shappiness, that idea which had formerly been the cause of his feverand sleeplessness, did not even present itself to his mind. He was in astate of collapse from all his past sufferings, and he was fully enteredon optimism. Cosette was by his side, she seemed to be his; an opticalillusion which every one has experienced. He arranged in his own mind,with all sorts of felicitous devices, his departure for England withCosette, and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased,in the perspective of his revery.As he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenlyencountered something strange.In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he sawthe four lines which follow:--"My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. Weshall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. In a week weshall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th."Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard infront of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, hadforgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had leftit wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid todry the four lines which she had penned, and which she had given incharge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had beenprinted off on the blotter.The mirror reflected the writing.The result was, what is called in geometry, the symmetrical image; sothat the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror andpresented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his eyesthe letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.It was simple and withering.Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, buthe did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing ina flash of lightning. It was a hallucination, it was impossible. It wasnot so.Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked atCosette's blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returnedto him. He caught up the blotter and said: "It comes from there."He feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, thereversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw nosense in it. Then he said to himself: "But this signifies nothing; thereis nothing written here." And he drew a long breath with inexpressiblerelief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants?The soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted allillusions.He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been thedupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again hebeheld the vision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorableclearness. This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is areality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. Heunderstood.Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the oldarm-chair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, inutter bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light ofthe world had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written thatto some one. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible oncemore, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect oftaking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet receivedCosette's letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean Valjeanbefore delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean had notbeen vanquished by trial. He had been subjected to fearful proofs; noviolence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armedwith all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her preyand had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity when it hadbeen necessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man,had yielded up his liberty, risked his head, lost everything, sufferedeverything, and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such apoint that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like amartyr. His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might haveappeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld hisspiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened atthat moment. It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergonein the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him,this was the most terrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto.He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He feltthe plucking at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us sayrather, the only trial, is the loss of the beloved being.Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than asa father; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternitythe widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; heloved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and heloved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman tolove or a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, thatsentiment also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with therest, vague, ignorant, pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious,celestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than like an instinct,less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but realattraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his immense tendernessfor Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed andvirgin.Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have alreadyindicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that ofsouls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With theexception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood,Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything ofthat which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each otherhad not produced in him those successive green growths, tender green ordark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winterand in men who pass fifty. In short, and we have insisted on it morethan once, all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sumtotal was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father toCosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, thebrother, and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whomthere was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adoredher, and who held that child as his light, his home, his family, hiscountry, his paradise.Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was escapingfrom him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was glidingfrom him, like a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes thiscrushing proof: "another is the goal of her heart, another is the wishof her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but herfather, I no longer exist"; when he could no longer doubt, when hesaid to himself: "She is going away from me!" the grief which he feltsurpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had donefor the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being nothing!Then, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through him fromhead to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the immensereawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man's abyss howled.There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. Adespairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrustingaside and breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, arethe very man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlongflight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Fewamong us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. Whenthe limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue isdisconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced himselfafresh; he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes,over those four unobjectionable lines; and there arose within him sucha cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul wascrumbling away.He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of revery, withan apparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when aman's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue.He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without hishaving a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the precedingsummer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it wasstill the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was atthe bottom of it.The unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he hadfallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed,while he still fancied that he beheld the sun.His instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,certain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette's part,and he said to himself: "It is he."The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never missesits aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know thename, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, in thebackground of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the unknownprowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love adventures, thatidler of romance, that idiot, that coward, for it is cowardly to comeand make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who lovesthem.After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was atthe bottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded from thatquarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had solabored over his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolveall life, all misery, and all unhappiness into love, looked into his ownbreast and there beheld a spectre, Hate.Great griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one withexistence. The man into whom they enter feels something within himwithdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later onthey are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood ishot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body likethe flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its fullthickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses beatswhich can be returned to it, when one has time for redress, when allwomen and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are beforeone, when the force of life is complete, what is it in old age, whenthe years hasten on, growing ever paler, to that twilight hour when onebegins to behold the stars of the tomb?While he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose and askedher:--"In what quarter is it? Do you know?"Toussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:--"What is it, sir?"Jean Valjean began again: "Did you not tell me that just now that thereis fighting going on?""Ah! yes, sir," replied Toussaint. "It is in the direction ofSaint-Merry."There is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, fromthe most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, underthe impulse of a movement of this sort, and of which he was hardlyconscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in thestreet.Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. Heseemed to be listening.Night had come.CHAPTER II--THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHTHow long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragicmeditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he beenbent to breaking? Could he still rise and regain his footing in hisconscience upon something solid? He probably would not have been able totell himself.The street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidlyreturning home, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril.The lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situatedprecisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjeanwould not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examinedhim in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless asa form of ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells anda vague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all theseconvulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paulstruck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is man; thehour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean;Jean Valjean did not stir. Still, at about that moment, a brusque reportburst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet more violentfollowed; it was probably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de laChanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by Marius. At this doubledischarge, whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night, JeanValjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter whence the noiseproceeded; then he fell back upon the post again, folded his arms, andhis head slowly sank on his bosom again.He resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself.All at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, heheard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, inthe direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, heperceived a young, livid, and beaming face.Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue l'Homme Arme.Gavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something. Hesaw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him.Gavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself ontiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they wereall shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the frontsof five or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin shrugged hisshoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:--"Pardi!"Then he began to stare into the air again.Jean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind,would not have spoken to or even answered any one, felt irresistiblyimpelled to accost that child."What is the matter with you, my little fellow?" he said."The matter with me is that I am hungry," replied Gavroche frankly. Andhe added: "Little fellow yourself."Jean Valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five-franc piece.But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skippedvivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. Hehad caught sight of the lantern."See here," said he, "you still have your lanterns here. You aredisobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash thatfor me."And he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell withsuch a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in theopposite house cried: "There is 'Ninety-three' come again."The lantern oscillated violently, and went out. The street had suddenlybecome black."That's right, old street," ejaculated Gavroche, "put on yournight-cap."And turning to Jean Valjean:--"What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the endof the street? It's the Archives, isn't it? I must crumble up those bigstupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them."Jean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche."Poor creature," he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, "he ishungry."And he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand.Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he staredat it in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him.He knew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable tohim; he was delighted to see one close to. He said:--"Let us contemplate the tiger."He gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to JeanValjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:--"Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast.You can't bribe me. That has got five claws; but it doesn't scratch me.""Have you a mother?" asked Jean Valjean.Gavroche replied:--"More than you have, perhaps.""Well," returned Jean Valjean, "keep the money for your mother!"Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who wasaddressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence."Truly," said he, "so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns?""Break whatever you please.""You're a fine man," said Gavroche.And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets.His confidence having increased, he added:--"Do you belong in this street?""Yes, why?""Can you tell me where No. 7 is?""What do you want with No. 7?"Here the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrusthis nails energetically into his hair and contented himself withreplying:--"Ah! Here it is."An idea flashed through Jean Valjean's mind. Anguish does have thesegleams. He said to the lad:--"Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?""You?" said Gavroche. "You are not a woman.""The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?""Cosette," muttered Gavroche. "Yes, I believe that is the queer name.""Well," resumed Jean Valjean, "I am the person to whom you are todeliver the letter. Give it here.""In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade.""Of course," said Jean Valjean.Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out apaper folded in four.Then he made the military salute."Respect for despatches," said he. "It comes from the ProvisionalGovernment.""Give it to me," said Jean Valjean.Gavroche held the paper elevated above his head."Don't go and fancy it's a love letter. It is for a woman, but it's forthe people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not asthey are in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens[55] tocamels.""Give it to me.""After all," continued Gavroche, "you have the air of an honest man.""Give it to me quick.""Catch hold of it."And he handed the paper to Jean Valjean."And make haste, Monsieur What's-your-name, for Mamselle Cosette iswaiting."Gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark.Jean Valjean began again:--"Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?""There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly calledbrioches [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue dela Chanvrerie, and I'm going back there. Good evening, citizen."That said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly,fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight likethat of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though hemade a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley ofl'Homme Arme became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, thatstrange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of thedream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, andwas lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought thathe had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutesafter his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not themagnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once moreabruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his waythrough the Rue du Chaume.CHAPTER III--WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEPJean Valjean went into the house with Marius' letter.He groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owlwho grips his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to seewhether he could hear any noise,--made sure that, to all appearances,Cosette and Toussaint were asleep, and plunged three or four matchesinto the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark, sogreatly did his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft. Atlast the candle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfoldedthe paper, and read.In violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so tospeak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, onecrushes it, one digs into it the nails of one's wrath, or of one's joy;one hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; attention is atfever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the essential points;it seizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius' note toCosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:--"I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee."In the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he remainedfor a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion whichwas taking place within him, he stared at Marius' note with a sort ofintoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes that splendor, the deathof a hated individual.He uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. Thecatastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being whoobstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself offof his own accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death,and he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was throughno fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his feverentered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter hadevidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning;after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock andmidnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will not beattacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, fromthe moment when "that man" is concerned in this war, he is lost; he iscaught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he wasabout to find himself alone with Cosette once more. The rivalry wouldcease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note inhis pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man. Allthat there requires to be done is to let things take their own course.This man cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is certain that heis about to die. What good fortune!Having said all this to himself, he became gloomy.Then he went down stairs and woke up the porter.About an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume ofa National Guard, and with his arms. The porter had easily found in theneighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. He had a loadedgun and a cartridge-box filled with cartridges.He strode off in the direction of the markets.CHAPTER IV--GAVROCHE'S EXCESS OF ZEALIn the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.Gavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue duChaume, entered the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, and not seeing "even acat" there, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all thesong of which he was capable. His march, far from being retarded by hissinging, was accelerated by it. He began to sow along the sleeping orterrified houses these incendiary couplets:--               "L'oiseau medit dans les charmilles,               Et pretend qu'hier Atala               Avec un Russe s'en alla.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Mon ami Pierrot, tu babilles,               Parce que l'autre jour Mila               Cogna sa vitre et m'appela,                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Les drolesses sont fort gentilles,               Leur poison qui m'ensorcela               Griserait Monsieur Orfila.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "J'aime l'amour et les bisbilles,               J'aime Agnes, j'aime Pamela,               Lisa en m'allumant se brula.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Jadis, quand je vis les mantilles               De Suzette et de Zeila,               Mon ame aleurs plis se mela,                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Amour, quand dans l'ombre ou tu brilles,                Tu coiffes de roses Lola,               Je me damnerais pour cela.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Jeanne a ton miroir tu t'habilles!               Mon coeur un beau jour s'envola.               Je crois que c'est Jeanne qui l'a.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Le soir, en sortant des quadrilles,               Je montre aux etoiles Stella,               Et je leur dis: 'Regardez-la.'                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la."[56]Gavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the strongpoint of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks,produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of acloth torn in a high gale. Unfortunately, as he was alone, and as it wasnight, this was neither seen nor even visible. Such wastes of riches dooccur.All at once, he stopped short."Let us interrupt the romance," said he.His feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door,what is called in painting, an ensemble, that is to say, a person anda thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from Auvergenewho was sleeping therein.The shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat's headwas supported against the front of the cart. His body was coiled up onthis inclined plane and his feet touched the ground.Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recognizeda drunken man. He was some corner errand-man who had drunk too much andwas sleeping too much."There now," thought Gavroche, "that's what the summer nights are goodfor. We'll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat forthe Monarchy."His mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:--"How bully that cart would look on our barricade!"The Auvergnat was snoring.Gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the Auvergnatfrom the front, that is to say, by the feet, and at the expiration ofanother minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat on thepavement.The cart was free.Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, hadeverything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled fromit a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter.He wrote:--                         "French Republic."    "Received thy cart."    And he signed it:  "GAVROCHE."That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoringAuvergnat's velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and setoff in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before him at ahard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar.This was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment.Gavroche did not think of this. This post was occupied by the NationalGuards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and heads were raisedfrom camp beds. Two street lanterns broken in succession, that dittysung at the top of the lungs. This was a great deal for those cowardlystreets, which desire to go to sleep at sunset, and which put theextinguisher on their candles at such an early hour. For the last hour,that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement,the uproar of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant of the banlieue lent anear. He waited. He was a prudent man.The mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible measureof waiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance."There's a whole band of them there!" said he, "let us proceed gently."It was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and thatit was stalking abroad through the quarter.And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the verymoment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes,found himself face to face with a uniform, a shako, a plume, and a gun.For the second time, he stopped short."Hullo," said he, "it's him. Good day, public order."Gavroche's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed."Where are you going, you rascal?" shouted the sergeant."Citizen," retorted Gavroche, "I haven't called you 'bourgeois' yet. Whydo you insult me?""Where are you going, you rogue?""Monsieur," retorted Gavroche, "perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday,but you have degenerated this morning.""I ask you where are you going, you villain?"Gavroche replied:--"You speak prettily. Really, no one would suppose you as old as you are.You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. That wouldyield you five hundred francs.""Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going, bandit?"Gavroche retorted again:--"What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first timethat they give you suck."The sergeant lowered his bayonet."Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?""General," said Gavroche "I'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wifewho is in labor.""To arms!" shouted the sergeant.The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by thevery means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole situationat a glance. It was the cart which had told against him, it was thecart's place to protect him.At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descenton Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with allthe latter's might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the sergeant,struck full in the stomach, tumbled over backwards into the gutter whilehis gun went off in the air.The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant's shout;the shot brought on a general random discharge, after which theyreloaded their weapons and began again.This blind-man's-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour andkilled several panes of glass.In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed,halted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on thestone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.He listened.After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where thefusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose andthrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head withhis right hand; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindomhas condensed French irony, and which is evidently efficacious, since ithas already lasted half a century.This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection."Yes," said he, "I'm splitting with laughter, I'm twisting withdelight, I abound in joy, but I'm losing my way, I shall have to take aroundabout way. If I only reach the barricade in season!"Thereupon he set out again on a run.And as he ran:--"Ah, by the way, where was I?" said he.And he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets, andthis is what died away in the gloom:--               "Mais il reste encore des bastilles,               Et je vais mettre le hola               Dans l'orde public que voila.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Quelqu'un veut-il jouer aux quilles?               Tout l'ancien monde s'ecroula               Quand la grosse boule roula.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Vieux bon peuple, a coups de bequilles,               Cassons ce Louvre ou s'etala               La monarchie en falbala.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la.               "Nous en avons force les grilles,               Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour la,               Tenait mal et se decolla.                    Ou vont les belles filles,                         Lon la."[57]The post's recourse to arms was not without result. The cart wasconquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner. The first was put in thepound, the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councilsof war as an accomplice. The public ministry of the day proved itsindefatigable zeal in the defence of society, in this instance.Gavroche's adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in the quartersof the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderlybourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their memories: "Thenocturnal attack by the post of the Royal Printing Establishment."[THE END OF VOLUME IV. "SAINT DENIS"]VOLUME V--JEAN VALJEAN[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Five ][Illustration: Titlepage Volume Five ]BOOK FIRST.--THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLSCHAPTER I--THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OFTHE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLEThe two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladiescan name do not belong to the period in which the action of this workis laid. These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two differentaspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at the timeof the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of the streetsthat history has ever beheld.It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary toliberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote,even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of itsanguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions, of its fevers, ofits distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, of its darkness, thatgreat and despairing body, the rabble, protests against, and that thepopulace wages battle against, the people.Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of nighteven in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those wordswhich are intended to be insults--beggars, canaille, ochlocracy,populace--exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those who reign than thefault of those who suffer; rather the fault of the privileged than thefault of the disinherited.For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain andwithout respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which theycorrespond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athenswas an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the populacesaved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus Christ.There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificencesof the lower classes.It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, and ofall these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserablepeople whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered thismysterious saying: "Fex urbis, lex orbis,"--the dregs of the city, thelaw of the earth.The exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, its violencescontrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are itslife, its masterful deeds against the right, are its popular coupsd'etat and should be repressed. The man of probity sacrifices himself,and out of his very love for this crowd, he combats it. But howexcusable he feels it even while holding out against it! How hevenerates it even while resisting it! This is one of those rare momentswhen, while doing that which it is one's duty to do, one feels somethingwhich disconcerts one, and which would dissuade one from proceedingfurther; one persists, it is necessary, but conscience, thoughsatisfied, is sad, and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with apain at the heart.June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almostimpossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All thewords which we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it becomesa question of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holyanxiety of toil claiming its rights. It was necessary to combat it, andthis was a duty, for it attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848,at bottom? A revolt of the people against itself.Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we,then, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a moment on thetwo absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and whichcharacterized this insurrection.One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the otherdefended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom thesetwo fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath thebrilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high,and seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg,that is to say, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged,cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with pilesthat were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there,powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of thefaubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of theformidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricadeswere ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streetsbehind this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt theagonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached thatpoint of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what wasthat barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolishedexpressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others. It worethe lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. It might beasked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who destroyed this? It wasthe improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating!this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this broken brazier! this crackedpot! Give all! cast away all! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn,ruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block ofstone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane,the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and themalediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodiedon the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip ofruined wall and the broken bowl,--threatening fraternization ofevery sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job hispotsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis of the barefooted.Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense dray wasspread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed ascar on that tumultuous facade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force,to the very summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit ofsavagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to theirterror, presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows whathorses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt,figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89,the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situationdeserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the veryspot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, itis thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon thisshapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbubpetrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as thoughthere had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress.Was it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigoseemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. There wassomething of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something Olympian inthat confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, therafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper,window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaitingthe cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howlingtopsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the veryrefuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury andnothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people,rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg SaintAntoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of thebroom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling headsman'sblocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets havingthe form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish,amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the oldtortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine convertedeverything into a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at thehead of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm;the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were someblunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even thecasters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account ofthe brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds aninexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, itwas covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flamingheads crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, ofsabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flagflapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll ofdrums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starvingwere to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the back of anelectric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. Thespirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbledthat voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strangemajesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. It was a heap offilth and it was Sinai.As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of therevolution--what? The revolution. It--that barricade, chance, hazard,disorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown--had facing it theConstituent Assembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage,the nation, the republic; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance tothe Marseillaise.Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourgshouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of thefaubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against whichthe strategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, itsexcrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, andgrinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; thebombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes in it;what was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed tothe fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species ofredoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by itsenormous size.A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple whichdebouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, if one thrust one'shead bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop,one perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street whichmounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, astrange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sortof hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, asthough the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in orderto close itself abruptly. This wall was built of paving-stones. It wasstraight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, laidout by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the caseof certain Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture.The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distanceto distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisibleloopholes which resembled black threads. These loopholes were separatedfrom each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as theeye could reach. All windows and doors were closed. In the backgroundrose this barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, amotionless and tranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible;not a cry, not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it wasimpossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful beforethis mysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated,rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. Onefelt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre.One looked at it and spoke low.From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of thepeople, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistlewas heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped thebullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closedshutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or in theplaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made themselves twosmall cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe, plugged up atone end with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of useless powder.Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and there, and pools ofblood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly which went and camein the street. Summer does not abdicate.In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cocheres wereencumbered with wounded.One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see, and oneunderstood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal formsat the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the attackingcolumn, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this dismal redoubt, thisimmobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. Some crawled flat ontheir faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge, taking carethat their shakos did not project beyond it.The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with ashudder.--"How that is built!" he said to a Representative. "Not onepaving-stone projects beyond its neighbor. It is made of porcelain."--Atthat moment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast, and he fell."The cowards!" people said. "Let them show themselves. Let us see them!They dare not! They are hiding!"The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men,attacked by ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, theydid as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they cameover the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowardsthought of flight, all were killed there with the exception of theleader, Barthelemy, of whom we shall speak presently.The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricadeof the Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubtswas the difference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed amaw; the other a mask.Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composedof a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first barricade thedragon, and behind the second the sphinx.These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one,Cournet, the other, Barthelemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoinebarricade; Barthelemy the barricade of the Temple. Each was the image ofthe man who had built it.Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face,a crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye.Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, themost formidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very airhe breathed and put him in a good humor. He had been an officer in thenavy, and, from his gestures and his voice, one divined that he sprangfrom the ocean, and that he came from the tempest; he carried thehurricane on into battle. With the exception of the genius, there wasin Cournet something of Danton, as, with the exception of the divinity,there was in Danton something of Hercules.Barthelemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic streeturchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, lay in wait forhim, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He cameout and made this barricade.Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, Barthelemyslew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, caught inthe gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passionplays a part, a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuatingcircumstances, and in which English justice sees only death, Barthelemywas hanged. The sombre social construction is so made that, thanks tomaterial destitution, thanks to moral obscurity, that unhappy beingwho possessed an intelligence, certainly firm, possibly great, beganin France with the galleys, and ended in England with the gallows.Barthelemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.CHAPTER II--WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSESixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, andJune, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So thebarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an embryocompared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched; butit was formidable for that epoch.The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer lookedafter anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had beennot only repaired, but augmented. They had raised it two feet. Barsof iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts ofrubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the externalconfusion. The redoubt had been cleverly made over, into a wall on theinside and a thicket on the outside.The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like thewall of a citadel had been reconstructed.The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, thekitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the woundedcompleted, the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had beengathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped, thefallen weapons re-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned, therubbish swept up, corpses removed.They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondetour lane, of which they werestill the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot.Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs.Enjolras had their uniforms laid aside.Enjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was acommand. Still, only three or four took advantage of it.Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on thewall which faced the tavern:--                     LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could bestill read on the wall in 1848.The three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanishdefinitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.They had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.The greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still.On a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which hadbeen converted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely wounded,two of whom were municipal guardsmen. The municipal guardsmen wereattended to first.In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth andJavert bound to his post."This is the hall of the dead," said Enjolras.In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, themortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort ofvast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone.The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, wasstill sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.Enjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing whathe said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of theold man's.No repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The fiftymen in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions ofthe wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there. At agiven moment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la Meduse.They were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had then reachedthe first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June when, in thebarricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the insurgents who demandedbread, replied to all combatants crying: "Something to eat!" with: "Why?It is three o'clock; at four we shall be dead."As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. Heinterdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed.Enjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up againsaid:--"It's the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business asa grocer."--"It must be real wine," observed Bossuet. "It's lucky thatGrantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal ofdifficulty in saving those bottles."--Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs,placed his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one mighttouch them, he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeufwas lying.About two o'clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. Therewere still thirty-seven of them.The day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in itscavity in the pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of thebarricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street,was bathed in shadows, and resembled, athwart the vague, twilighthorror, the deck of a disabled ship. The combatants, as they wentand came, moved about there like black forms. Above that terriblenesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividlyoutlined; at the very top, the chimneys stood palely out. The sky was ofthat charming, undecided hue, which may be white and may be blue. Birdsflew about in it with cries of joy. The lofty house which formed theback of the barricade, being turned to the East, had upon its roof arosy reflection. The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head ofthe dead man at the third-story window."I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished," said Courfeyracto Feuilly. "That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had theappearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom ofcowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles."Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.Joly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy fromit."What is the cat?" he exclaimed. "It is a corrective. The good God,having made the mouse, said: 'Hullo! I have committed a blunder.' Andso he made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plusthe cat, is the proof of creation revised and corrected."Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of thedead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, andof Enjolras' sad severity. He said:--"Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell,Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it wastoo late. Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that,even in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, ifthere be such a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses thejoy of having served the human race."And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a momentlater, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire's verses,Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux withCournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translatedby Malfilatre, particularly the prodigies of Caesar's death; and at thatword, Caesar, the conversation reverted to Brutus."Caesar," said Combeferre, "fell justly. Cicero was severe towardsCaesar, and he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoilusinsults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Vise insults Moliere,when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is anold law of envy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attractsinsult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoilus andCicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, justas Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that lastjustice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Caesar, the violatorof the Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the dignitieswhich emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of thesenate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia acpene tyrannica. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much thebetter; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three woundstouch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Caesar isstabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One feels the Godthrough the greater outrage."Bossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heapof paving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:--"Oh Cydathenaeum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of theAEantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses of Homer like aGreek of Laurium or of Edapteon?"CHAPTER III--LIGHT AND SHADOWEnjolras had been to make a reconnaissance. He had made his way outthrough Mondetour lane, gliding along close to the houses.The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in whichthey had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them toalmost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it witha smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to theircause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. Theyreckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is oneof the sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided theday which was at hand into three distinct phases. At six o'clock in themorning a regiment "which had been labored with," would turn; at noon,the insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.They heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent foran instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade, thegreat one, Jeanne's, still held out.All these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort ofgay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive ofbees.Enjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight into outerdarkness. He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms, andone hand on his mouth. Then, fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness ofthe dawn, he said:"The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearingdown upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the NationalGuard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of theline, and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you willbe attacked. As for the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-dayit is not stirring. There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for.Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned."These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on themthe effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. Amoment of indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have beenheard flitting by.This moment was brief.A voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:"So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, andlet us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of corpses.Let us show that, if the people abandon the republicans, the republicansdo not abandon the people."These words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud ofindividual anxieties. It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation.No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was someunknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, thatgreat anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social geneseswho, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word,and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute,in a lightning flash, the people and God.This inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the6th of June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, on the barricadeSaint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become amatter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in thecase:--"What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not? Letus get ourselves killed here, to the very last man."As the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated, werein communication with each other.CHAPTER IV--MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONEAfter the man who decreed the "protest of corpses" had spoken, and hadgiven this formula of their common soul, there issued from all mouths astrangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in sense and triumphantin tone:"Long live death! Let us all remain here!""Why all?" said Enjolras."All! All!"Enjolras resumed:"The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. Whysacrifice forty?"They replied:"Because not one will go away.""Citizens," cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated vibrationin his voice, "this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge inuseless expenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. If the duty of some isto depart, that duty should be fulfilled like any other."Enjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort ofomnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as wasthis omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips,Enjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily:"Let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so."The murmurs redoubled."Besides," observed a voice in one group, "it is easy enough to talkabout leaving. The barricade is hemmed in.""Not on the side of the Halles," said Enjolras. "The Rue Mondetour isfree, and through the Rue des Precheurs one can reach the Marche desInnocents.""And there," went on another voice, "you would be captured. You wouldfall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spya man passing in blouse and cap. 'Whence come you?' 'Don't you belong tothe barricade?' And they will look at your hands. You smell of powder.Shot."Enjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre's shoulder, andthe two entered the tap-room.They emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his outstretchedhands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. Combeferre followed,carrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos."With this uniform," said Enjolras, "you can mingle with the ranks andescape; here is enough for four." And he flung on the ground, deprivedof its pavement, the four uniforms.No wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took theword."Come," said he, "you must have a little pity. Do you know what thequestion is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are therewomen or are there not? Are there children or are there not? Are theremothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lotof little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld anurse's breast raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, sodo I--I, who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantomsof women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, butdon't make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink ofaccomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does notadmit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicideis murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks.Listen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Ruedu Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifthfloor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman,who had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps she isthe mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make haste, tosay to his mother: 'Here I am, mother!' Let him feel at ease, the taskhere will be performed all the same. When one supports one's relativesby one's toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one's self. Thatis deserting one's family. And those who have daughters! what are youthinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. Andtomorrow? Young girls without bread--that is a terrible thing. Man begs,woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and sosweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, whosing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existenceof angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne,that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are yourblessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! What doyou want me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and itis not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that youwill prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of thepavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which womengo and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These women,too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them.Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare--that is what thosebeautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentlenessand loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to.Ah! you have got yourselves killed! You are no longer on hand! Thatis well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty, and youdeliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a care, havemercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of bestowing muchthought on them. We trust to the women not having received a man'seducation, we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, weprevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent themfrom going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies?Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, and shake handswith us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend tothis affair. I know well that courage is required to leave, that it ishard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. You say: 'I have agun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain there.' Somuch the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a morrow; you willnot be here to-morrow, but your families will; and what sufferings! See,here is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like an apple, who babbles,prattles, chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet beneath your kiss,--anddo you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I have seen one,a very small creature, no taller than that. His father was dead. Poorpeople had taken him in out of charity, but they had bread only forthemselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry.You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire,and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay. His breathingwas hoarse, his face livid, his limbs flaccid, his belly prominent. Hesaid nothing. If you spoke to him, he did not answer. He is dead. He wastaken to the Necker Hospital, where I saw him. I was house-surgeon inthat hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whosehappiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child's tiny hand intheir robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this childis his own. That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, whenhe lay nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skinlike the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was foundin his stomach. There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us examineourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart. Statisticsshow that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent.I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, it concernsyoung girls, it concerns little children. Who is talking to you ofyourselves? We know well what you are; we know well that you are allbrave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your souls the joy andthe glory of giving your life for the great cause; we know well that youfeel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that eachone of you clings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you arenot alone in this world. There are other beings of whom you must think.You must not be egoists."All dropped their heads with a gloomy air.Strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments.Combeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. He recalled the mothersof other men, and forgot his own. He was about to get himself killed. Hewas "an egoist."Marius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope,and having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, andsaturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near,had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which alwaysprecedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted.A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of thatfebrile absorption known to, and classified by, science, and which isto suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. Despair, also, has itsecstasy. Marius had reached this point. He looked on at everything asfrom without; as we have said, things which passed before him seemed faraway; he made out the whole, but did not perceive the details. He beheldmen going and coming as through a flame. He heard voices speaking as atthe bottom of an abyss.But this moved him. There was in this scene a point which pierced androused even him. He had but one idea now, to die; and he did not wish tobe turned aside from it, but he reflected, in his gloomy somnambulism,that while destroying himself, he was not prohibited from saving someone else.He raised his voice."Enjolras and Combeferre are right," said he; "no unnecessary sacrifice.I join them, and you must make haste. Combeferre has said convincingthings to you. There are some among you who have families, mothers,sisters, wives, children. Let such leave the ranks."No one stirred."Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!"repeated Marius.His authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head of thebarricade, but Marius was its savior."I order it," cried Enjolras."I entreat you," said Marius.Then, touched by Combeferre's words, shaken by Enjolras' order, touchedby Marius' entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce each other.--"Itis true," said one young man to a full grown man, "you are the fatherof a family. Go."--"It is your duty rather," retorted the man, "you havetwo sisters whom you maintain."--And an unprecedented controversy brokeforth. Each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to beplaced at the door of the tomb."Make haste," said Courfeyrac, "in another quarter of an hour it will betoo late.""Citizens," pursued Enjolras, "this is the Republic, and universalsuffrage reigns. Do you yourselves designate those who are to go."They obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five wereunanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks."There are five of them!" exclaimed Marius.There were only four uniforms."Well," began the five, "one must stay behind."And then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should findreasons for the others not remaining. The generous quarrel began afresh."You have a wife who loves you."--"You have your aged mother."--" Youhave neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your threelittle brothers?"--"You are the father of five children."--"You have aright to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early for you to die."These great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism.The improbable was simple there. These men did not astonish each other."Be quick," repeated Courfeyrac.Men shouted to Marius from the groups:"Do you designate who is to remain.""Yes," said the five, "choose. We will obey you."Marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. Still,at this idea, that of choosing a man for death, his blood rushed backto his heart. He would have turned pale, had it been possible for him tobecome any paler.He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, with hiseyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of historyhovering over Thermopylae, cried to him:"Me! me! me!"And Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! Thenhis glance dropped to the four uniforms.At that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the otherfour.The fifth man was saved.Marius raised his eyes and recognized M. Fauchelevent.Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade.He had arrived by way of Mondetour lane, whither by dint of inquiriesmade, or by instinct, or chance. Thanks to his dress of a NationalGuardsman, he had made his way without difficulty.The sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondetour had nooccasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman, and he hadallowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, saying to himself:"Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it is a prisoner." Themoment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty andhis post of observation.At the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had noticedhim, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms.Jean Valjean also had seen and heard, and he had silently removed hiscoat and flung it on the pile with the rest.The emotion aroused was indescribable."Who is this man?" demanded Bossuet."He is a man who saves others," replied Combeferre.Marius added in a grave voice:"I know him."This guarantee satisfied every one.Enjolras turned to Jean Valjean."Welcome, citizen."And he added:"You know that we are about to die."Jean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was savingto don his uniform.CHAPTER V--THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADEThe situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place, had asresult and culminating point Enjolras' supreme melancholy.Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he wasincomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too muchof Saint-Just about him, and not enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still,his mind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended byundergoing a certain polarization from Combeferre's ideas; for some timepast, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma, andhad allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress,and he had come to accept, as a definitive and magnificent evolution,the transformation of the great French Republic, into the immensehuman republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violentsituation being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he nevervaried; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which issummed up in the words: "Eighty-three." Enjolras was standing erect onthe staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock ofhis gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage ofprophetic breaths; places where death is have these effects of tripods.A sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes, which were filled with aninward look. All at once he threw back his head, his blond locks fellback like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, theywere like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, andEnjolras cried:"Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets ofcities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nationssisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving thepresent, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on terms of fullequality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human consciencebecome an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and theschool, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right forall, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! Toconquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is the second.Reflect on what progress has already accomplished. Formerly, thefirst human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes,breathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin whowas the monster of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagleand the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. Man,nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence, andfinally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra, andit is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing thegriffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the daywhen this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall havedefinitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimaera of antiquity, thehydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire,and of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation that whichthe ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens,whither are we going? To science made government, to the force of thingsbecome the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself itssanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawnof truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing to the unionof peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions;no more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal.Civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and,later on, at the centre of continents, in a grand parliament of theintelligence. Something similar has already been seen. The amphictyonshad two sittings a year, one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the otherat Thermopylae, the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons;the globe will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future inher breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That whichGreece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. Listen to me,you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, youclearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither fathernor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and rightfor your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here.Citizens, whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well asthrough our victory, it is a revolution that we are about to create.As conflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate thewhole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I havejust told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point ofview, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man overhimself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Wheretwo or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. Butin that association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes acertain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming the common right.This quantity is the same for all of us. This identity of concessionwhich each makes to all, is called Equality. Common right is nothingelse than the protection of all beaming on the right of each. Thisprotection of all over each is called Fraternity. The point ofintersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society.This intersection being a junction, this point is a knot. Hence whatis called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the samething, the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of abond. Let us come to an understanding about equality; for, if libertyis the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, is not wholly asurface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks; aproximity of jealousies which render each other null and void; legallyspeaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity;politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; religiously,it is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equality has anorgan: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet,that is where the beginning must be made. The primary school imposedon all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From anidentical school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction!light! light! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns.Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth centurywill be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of old,we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an invasion,a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption ofcivilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditarytyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment becauseof the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting faceto face, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; weshall no longer have to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arisingfrom distress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and thesword, and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events.One might almost say: There will be no more events. We shall be happy.The human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial globeaccomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between the souland the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planetaround the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressingyou, is a gloomy hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future.A revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up,consoled! We affirm it on this barrier. Whence should proceed that cryof love, if not from the heights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this isthe point of junction, of those who think and of those who suffer; thisbarricade is not made of paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits ofiron; it is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Heremisery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: 'Iam about to die, and thou shalt be born again with me.' From the embraceof all desolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings bring hither theiragony and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality areabout to join and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here diesin the radiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all floodedwith the dawn."Enjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to movesilently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused them allto gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. There was noapplause; but they whispered together for a long time. Speech being abreath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves.CHAPTER VI--MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONICLet us narrate what was passing in Marius' thoughts.Let the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it,everything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius,let us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, darkwings which are spread over those in the death agony. He felt that hehad entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the otherside of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living exceptwith the eyes of one dead.How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he comethere to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself.Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops othersas well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the world shouldcome thither to die.Only, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.However, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him, andhad not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice tosay: "I know him."As far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent wascomforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions,we should say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absoluteimpossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was, in his eyes,both equivocal and imposing. Moreover, it had been a long time sincehe had seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility forMarius' timid and reserved nature.The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondetour lane; theybore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of themwept as he took his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those whoremained.When the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, Enjolrasthought of the man who had been condemned to death.He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged inmeditation."Do you want anything?" Enjolras asked him.Javert replied: "When are you going to kill me?""Wait. We need all our cartridges just at present.""Then give me a drink," said Javert.Enjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert waspinioned, he helped him to drink."Is that all?" inquired Enjolras."I am uncomfortable against this post," replied Javert. "You are nottender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please,but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man."And with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at theend of the room, on which they had been running bullets and makingcartridges. All the cartridges having been made, and all the powderused, this table was free.At Enjolras' command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post.While they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.Leaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet aslender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mountingthe scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches inlength, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room, wherethey laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.By way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck,they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attemptat escape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons amartingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach, and meetsthe hands, after passing between the legs.While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold wassurveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this man madeJavert turn his head. He raised his eyes, and recognized Jean Valjean.He did not even start, but dropped his lids proudly and confined himselfto the remark: "It is perfectly simple."CHAPTER VII--THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATEDThe daylight was increasing rapidly. Not a window was opened, not a doorstood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue dela Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by thetroops, as we have stated it seemed to be free, and presented itself topassers-by with a sinister tranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was asdumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in thecross-roads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun. Nothing is somournful as this light in deserted streets. Nothing was to be seen, butthere was something to be heard. A mysterious movement was going on ata certain distance. It was evident that the critical moment wasapproaching. As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; butthis time all had come.The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack.Since the departure of the five, they had increased its height stillfurther.On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of theHalles, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a seriousdecision. He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane, which had beenleft open up to that time, barricaded. For this purpose, they tore upthe pavement for the length of several houses more. In this manner,the barricade, walled on three streets, in front on the Rue dela Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la PetiteTruanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondetour, was really almostimpregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. Ithad three fronts, but no exit.--"A fortress but a rat hole too," saidCourfeyrac with a laugh.Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones "torn up in excess," saidBossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack mustneeds come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Eachman selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbowand crowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones.Here is a corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; hereis a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind it.Left-handed men are precious; they take the places that are inconvenientto the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to beat ease to kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848,an insurgent who was a formidable marksman, and who was firing from thetop of a terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there forhis use; a charge of grape-shot found him out there.As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action,all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from oneanother; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is no moreholding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in, and changesinto, a waiting for the assailants. A barricade before the arrival ofdanger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. Peril producesorder.As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, and hadplaced himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself,all the rest held their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises resoundedconfusedly along the wall of paving-stones. It was the men cocking theirguns.Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; theexcess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope,but they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which sometimes givesvictory; Virgil has said so. Supreme resources spring from extremeresolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping ashipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, wemight almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up andvisible.They had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leuquarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. Aclashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brassskipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced thatsome sinister construction of iron was approaching. There arose a tremorin the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built for thefertile circulation of interests and ideas, and which are not made forthe horrible rumble of the wheels of war.The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the streetbecame ferocious.A cannon made its appearance.Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; thefore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four wereat the wheels; others followed with the caisson. They could see thesmoke of the burning lint-stock."Fire!" shouted Enjolras.The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche ofsmoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, thecloud dispersed, and the cannon and men re-appeared; the gun-crew hadjust finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into positionfacing the barricade. Not one of them had been struck. Then the captainof the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle,began to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling atelescope."Bravo for the cannoneers!" cried Bossuet.And the whole barricade clapped their hands.A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street,astride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable pairof jaws yawned on the barricade."Come, merrily now!" ejaculated Courfeyrac. "That's the brutal part ofit. After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army isreaching out its big paw to us. The barricade is going to be severelyshaken up. The fusillade tries, the cannon takes.""It is a piece of eight, new model, brass," added Combeferre. "Thosepieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tinto one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them tootender. Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers whenlooked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this danger, andto render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessaryto return to the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and toencircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands,from the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy thisdefect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes arelocated in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is abetter method, with Gribeauval's movable star.""In the sixteenth century," remarked Bossuet, "they used to riflecannon.""Yes," replied Combeferre, "that augments the projectile force, butdiminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range,the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola isexaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficientlyrectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increaseswith the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifledcannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballisticnecessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of thegun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all thatit desires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travelssix hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand leagues asecond. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.""Reload your guns," said Enjolras.How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under thecannon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. Whilethe insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were loadingthe cannon.The anxiety in the redoubt was profound.The shot sped the report burst forth."Present!" shouted a joyous voice.And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashedagainst it.He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimblyclimbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth ofthe Rue de la Petite Truanderie.Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than thecannon-ball.The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was anomnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeingthis, the barricade burst into a laugh."Go on!" shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.CHAPTER VIII--THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLYThey flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything. Mariusdrew him aside with a shudder."What are you doing here?""Hullo!" said the child, "what are you doing here yourself?"And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. His eyes grewlarger with the proud light within them.It was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:"Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?"Gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter.In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it ratherthan delivered it. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that he hadconfided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not beenable to make out. It is true that the man was bareheaded, but that wasnot sufficient. In short, he had been administering to himself littleinward remonstrances and he feared Marius' reproaches. In order toextricate himself from the predicament, he took the simplest course; helied abominably."Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. Shewill have the letter when she wakes up."Marius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell toCosette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with thehalf of his desire.The despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in thebarricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. He pointed out M.Fauchelevent to Gavroche."Do you know that man?""No," said Gavroche.Gavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean onlyat night.The troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves inMarius' mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fauchelevent's opinions?Perhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very naturalpresence in this combat.In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of thebarricade: "My gun!"Courfeyrac had it returned to him.Gavroche warned "his comrades" as he called them, that the barricade wasblocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of theline whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was onthe watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, themunicipal guard occupied the Rue des Precheurs. The bulk of the army wasfacing them in front.This information given, Gavroche added:"I authorize you to hit 'em a tremendous whack."Meanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears and watching at hisembrasure.The assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had notrepeated it.A company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end ofthe street behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were tearing upthe pavement and constructing with the stones a small, low wall, asort of side-work not more than eighteen inches high, and facing thebarricade. In the angle at the left of this epaulement, there wasvisible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed inthe Rue Saint-Denis.Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar soundwhich is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from thecaissons, and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevationand incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. Then thecannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized the lint-stockhimself and lowered it to the vent."Down with your heads, hug the wall!" shouted Enjolras, "and all on yourknees along the barricade!"The insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, andwho had quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival, rushedpell-mell towards the barricade; but before Enjolras' order could beexecuted, the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a roundof grape-shot. This is what it was, in fact.The charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had thererebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced two deadand three wounded.If this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. Thegrape-shot made its way in.A murmur of consternation arose."Let us prevent the second discharge," said Enjolras.And, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, who, atthat moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifyingand definitely fixing its pointing.The captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, veryyoung, blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent air peculiarto that predestined and redoubtable weapon which, by dint of perfectingitself in horror, must end in killing war.Combeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this youngman."What a pity!" said Combeferre. "What hideous things these butcheriesare! Come, when there are no more kings, there will be no more war.Enjolras, you are taking aim at that sergeant, you are not looking athim. Fancy, he is a charming young man; he is intrepid; it is evidentthat he is thoughtful; those young artillery-men are very well educated;he has a father, a mother, a family; he is probably in love; he is notmore than five and twenty at the most; he might be your brother.""He is," said Enjolras."Yes," replied Combeferre, "he is mine too. Well, let us not kill him.""Let me alone. It must be done."And a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras' marble cheek.At the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flameleaped forth. The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms extended infront of him, his head uplifted, as though for breath, then he fell withhis side on the gun, and lay there motionless. They could see his back,from the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood. Theball had traversed his breast from side to side. He was dead.He had to be carried away and replaced by another. Several minutes werethus gained, in fact.CHAPTER IX--EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THATINFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun wasabout to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold outa quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden theblows.Enjolras issued this command:"We must place a mattress there.""We have none," said Combeferre, "the wounded are lying on them."Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of thetavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, takenno part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear thecombatants saying around him: "Here is a gun that is doing nothing."At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Ruede la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed hermattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, was onthe roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade.The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two polesfor drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at thatdistance, looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nailsplanted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, likehairs, against the sky."Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?" said Jean Valjean.Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.One of the mattress ropes was cut.The mattress now hung by one thread only.Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panesof the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fellinto the street.The barricade applauded.All voices cried:"Here is a mattress!""Yes," said Combeferre, "but who will go and fetch it?"The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, betweenbesiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artilleryhaving exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes,been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones whichthey had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence ofthe piece, which was quiet while its service was in course ofreorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgentsdid not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition Thefusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled,was terrible.Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed thestorm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back,and returned to the barricade.He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it thereagainst the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not seeit.That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.It was not long in coming.The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. But therewas no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained.The barricade was saved."Citizen," said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, "the Republic thanks you."Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed:"It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph ofthat which yields over that which strikes with lightning. But nevermind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!"CHAPTER X--DAWNAt that moment, Cosette awoke.Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,facing the East on the back court-yard of the house.Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not beenthere on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to herchamber when Toussaint had said:"It appears that there is a row."Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweetdreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was verywhite. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. Sheawoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her theeffect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first thought onemerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette felt herselfthoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hourspreviously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutelywill not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all hermight, without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It wasthree days since she had seen Marius. But she said to herself that hemust have received her letter, that he knew where she was, and thathe was so clever that he would find means of reaching her.--And thatcertainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.--It was broad daylight,but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was veryearly, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive Marius.She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that, consequently,that was sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was valid.All this was certain. It was monstrous enough already to have sufferedfor three days. Marius absent three days, this was horrible on the partof the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from on high had been gonethrough with. Marius was about to arrive, and he would bring good news.Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow uselessand does not accept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presenceof an unknown quantity, which is itself. It is natural to it to behappy. It seems as though its respiration were made of hope.Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her onthe subject of this absence which was to last only one day, and whatexplanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed with whatnimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away andhides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There arethoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner ofour brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible tolay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless littleeffort made by her memory. She told herself, that it was very naughtyand very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by Marius.She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul andbody, her prayers and her toilet.One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into a nuptialchamber, not into a virginal chamber. Verse would hardly venture it,prose must not.It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is whitenessin the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, which must not begazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it. Woman in thebud is sacred. That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nuditywhich is afraid of itself, that white foot which takes refuge in aslipper, that throat which veils itself before a mirror as thougha mirror were an eye, that chemise which makes haste to rise up andconceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passingvehicle, those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces drawn,those tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisiteaffright in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where thereis no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming asthe clouds of dawn,--it is not fitting that all this should be narrated,and it is too much to have even called attention to it.The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of ayoung girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. The possibilityof hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. The down on thepeach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the snow, the wingof the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse compared to thatchastity which does not even know that it is chaste. The young girl isonly the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber ishidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glancebrutalizes this vague penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter ofCosette's rising.An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but thatAdam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she was ashamed andturned crimson. We are of the number who fall speechless in the presenceof young girls and flowers, since we think them worthy of veneration.Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her hair, whichwas a very simple matter in those days, when women did not swell outtheir curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put crinolinein their locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes around herin every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street, an angle ofthe house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able to watch forMarius there. But no view of the outside was to be had. The back courtwas surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only onseveral gardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: for the firsttime in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of thegutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She decided togaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come from thatquarter.All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness ofsoul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection--that was her case. She had aconfused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in theair, in fact. She told herself that she was not sure of anything, thatto withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Mariuscould return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming butmournful.Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hopeand a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust in God.Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence reigned.Not a shutter had been opened. The porter's lodge was closed. Toussainthad not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her father wasasleep. She must have suffered much, and she must have still beensuffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had beenunkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light wasdecidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in thedistance, and she said: "It is odd that people should be opening andshutting their carriage gates so early." They were the reports of thecannon battering the barricade.A few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectly blackcornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve of this nestformed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above itwas possible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father flutteredabout, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses.The dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, "Multiply," laythere smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in theglory of the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, hersoul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated by love within and by the dawnwithout, bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow toherself that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gazeat these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that mother andher little ones, with the profound trouble which a nest produces on avirgin.CHAPTER XI--THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONEThe assailants' fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated, butwithout committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone ofthe Corinthe facade suffered; the window on the first floor, and theattic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot and biscaiens, wereslowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there hadbeen obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tacticsof barricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust theinsurgents' ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When itis perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they have no morepowder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into thistrap; the barricade did not reply.At every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek with histongue, a sign of supreme disdain."Good for you," said he, "rip up the cloth. We want some lint."Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which itproduced, and said to the cannon:"You are growing diffuse, my good fellow."One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that thissilence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy,and to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt thenecessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones, andof knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which receivedblows without retorting. The insurgents suddenly perceived a helmetglittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. A fireman had placed hisback against a tall chimney, and seemed to be acting as sentinel. Hisglance fell directly down into the barricade."There's an embarrassing watcher," said Enjolras.Jean Valjean had returned Enjolras' rifle, but he had his own gun.Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later,the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. Theterrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer took hisplace. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded hisgun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's casque to join thesoldier's. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This timethe warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter onthat roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned."Why did you not kill the man?" Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean made no reply.CHAPTER XII--DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDERBossuet muttered in Combeferre's ear:"He did not answer my question.""He is a man who does good by gun-shots," said Combeferre.Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epochknow that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant againstinsurrections. It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days ofJune, 1832. A certain good dram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus orla Cunette, whose "establishment" had been closed by the riots, becameleonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killedto preserve the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois andheroic time, in the presence of ideas which had their knights, interestshad their paladins. The prosiness of the originators detracted nothingfrom the bravery of the movement. The diminution of a pile of crownsmade bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically forthe counting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense diminutiveof the fatherland, with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm.At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was notextremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, whileawaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order incombination with lack of discipline.The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such orsuch a Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went intoaction through inspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought,"for an idea," and on their own account. At critical moments, on "days"they took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. Thereexisted in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword,like Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrede.Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by anaggregation of interests than by a group of principles, was or thoughtitself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting himselfa centre, defended it, succored it, and protected it with his own head;and the first comer took it upon himself to save society.Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the NationalGuard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council ofwar, and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. Itwas an improvisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. FierceLynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest,for it has been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by themonarchy in Europe. This Lynch law was complicated with mistakes. On oneday of rioting, a young poet, named Paul Aime Garnier, was pursuedin the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only escaped bytaking refuge under the porte-cochere of No. 6. They shouted:--"There'sanother of those Saint-Simonians!" and they wanted to kill him. Now, hehad under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon.A National Guard had read the words Saint-Simon on the book, and hadshouted: "Death!"On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from thesuburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itselfdecimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own goodpleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at thejudicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort ofcondottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized,a fanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not resist thetemptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing thebarricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company.Exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the oldcoat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals andchiefs of the corps, who were holding council and did not think that themoment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were allowing "theinsurrection to fry in its own fat," to use the celebrated expressionof one of them. For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as thatwhich is ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.He commanded men as resolute as himself, "raging fellows," as a witnesssaid. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, wasthe first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At themoment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched his menagainst the barricade. This movement, executed with more good will thanstrategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed twothirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from thebarricade. Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front,were mown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and thiscourageous throng of National Guards, very brave men but lacking inmilitary tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation,leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gavethe insurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second and verydestructive discharge struck the company before it could regain thecorner of the street, its shelter. A moment more, and it was caughtbetween two fires, and it received the volley from the battery piecewhich, not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from thisgrape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.This attack, which was more furious than serious, irritatedEnjolras.--"The fools!" said he. "They are getting their own men killedand they are using up our ammunition for nothing."Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which hewas. Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons.Insurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain numberof shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend. An emptycartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has thearmy, it does not count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does notcount its shots. Repression has as many regiments as the barricade hasmen, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thusthey are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end incrushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly,flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. This does happensometimes. Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe, popularredoubts abound. Paris quivers supremely, the quid divinum is givenforth, a 10th of August is in the air, a 29th of July is in the air, awonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force draws back, and thearmy, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that prophet,France.CHAPTER XIII--PASSING GLEAMSIn the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, thereis a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor,enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, aboveall, intermittences of hope.One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope suddenlytraversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the moment whenit was least expected."Listen," suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, "it seemsto me that Paris is waking up."It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrectionbroke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacyof the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricadeswere begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In frontof the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attackedalone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, heplaced one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed thecommander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: "There's another whowill do us no more harm."He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on theNational Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind couldbe seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of agewas arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full ofcartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the RueBertin-Poiree, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomeda regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal GeneralCavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old piecesof pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; abad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon'sold lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's saying atSaragossa: "We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambreon our heads."These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment whenit was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this feverof wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deepmasses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,--allthis, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste tostamp out these beginnings of conflagration.They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie andSaint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that theymight have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finishthem at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there wasfermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left,now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke inthe doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time,manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. Thisrepression was not effected without some commotion, and without thattumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and thepeople. This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of thecannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passingthe end of the street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:--"Thosewounded do not come from us."Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In lessthan half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash oflightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort ofleaden cope, which the indifference of the people casts over obstinateand deserted men, fall over them once more.The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, hadmiscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy ofthe generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricadeswhich still remained standing.The sun was mounting above the horizon.An insurgent hailed Enjolras."We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, withoutanything to eat?"Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, made anaffirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the endof the street.CHAPTER XIV--WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESSCourfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued toinsult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectileswhich is called grape-shot passed overhead with its terrible sound heassailed it with a burst of irony."You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me,you are wasting your row. That's not thunder, it's a cough."And the bystanders laughed.Courfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with the peril,like Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry, and, as winewas lacking, they poured out gayety to all."I admire Enjolras," said Bossuet. "His impassive temerity astoundsme. He lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps; Enjolrascomplains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. The rest of ushave mistresses, more or less, who make us crazy, that is to say, brave.When a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least that he can do is tofight like a lion. That is one way of taking our revenge for the capersthat mesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself killed forAngelique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man without a womanis a pistol without a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off.Well, Enjolras has no woman. He is not in love, and yet he manages to beintrepid. It is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as iceand as bold as fire."Enjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been near him,that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice: "Patria."Bossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:"News!"And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:"My name is Eight-Pounder."In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was a secondpiece of ordnance.The artillery-men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placedthis second piece in line with the first.This outlined the catastrophe.A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firingpoint-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line and of thesoldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.Another cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time thatthe two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de laChanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis,the other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merrybarricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Ruede la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aimwas calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the uppercrest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents,mingled with bursts of grape-shot.The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents fromthe summit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close in theinterior, that is to say, this announced the assault.The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls,and from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columnscould venture into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even,without being seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt, as onthe preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise."It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those gunsshould be diminished," said Enjolras, and he shouted: "Fire on theartillery-men!"All were ready. The barricade, which had long been silent, poured fortha desperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed, with a sort ofrage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, at the endof a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked with flame, two thirdsof the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of thecannons. Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces withsevere tranquillity, but the fire had slackened."Things are going well now," said Bossuet to Enjolras. "Success."Enjolras shook his head and replied:"Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be anycartridges left in the barricade."It appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.CHAPTER XV--GAVROCHE OUTSIDECourfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of thebarricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets.Gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made hisway out through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying the fullcartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been killed on theslope of the redoubt, into his basket."What are you doing there?" asked Courfeyrac.Gavroche raised his face:--"I'm filling my basket, citizen.""Don't you see the grape-shot?"Gavroche replied:"Well, it is raining. What then?"Courfeyrac shouted:--"Come in!""Instanter," said Gavroche.And with a single bound he plunged into the street.It will be remembered that Fannicot's company had left behind it a trailof bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement,through the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavrochemeant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud whichhas fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments canimagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows oflofty houses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence atwilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatantscould hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other,short as it was.This obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by thecommanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was usefulto Gavroche.Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. Herifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basketin his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body toanother, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens anut.They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, whichwas quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.On one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask."For thirst," said he, putting it in his pocket.By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusilladebecame transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged onthe outlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of thebanlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to eachother something moving through the smoke.At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying neara stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body."Fichtre!" ejaculated Gavroche. "They are killing my dead men for me."A second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.--A thirdoverturned his basket.Gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,his hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who werefiring, and sang:      "On est laid a Nanterre,       "Men are ugly at Nanterre,       C'est la faute a Voltaire;     'Tis the  fault of Voltaire;       Et bete a Palaiseau,           And dull at Palaiseau,       C'est la faute a Rousseau."    'Tis the fault of Rousseau."Then he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had fallenfrom it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards thefusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There a fourthbullet missed him, again. Gavroche sang:       "Je ne suis pas notaire,      "I am not a notary,        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;        Je suis un petit oiseau,      I'm a little bird,        C'est la faute a Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of Rousseau."A fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet.       "Joie est mon caractere,      "Joy is my character,        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;        Misere est mon trousseau,     Misery is my trousseau,        C'est la faute a Rousseau."   'Tis the fault of Rousseau."Thus it went on for some time.It was a charming and terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, wasteasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It wasthe sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retortedwith a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always missed him. TheNational Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. Helay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway, then madea bound, disappeared, re-appeared, scampered away, returned, replied tothe grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went onpillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, and filling hisbasket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with theireyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a child, he was nota man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called theinvulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was morenimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death;every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, theurchin administered to it a fillip.One bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,finally struck the will-o'-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen tostagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to acry; but there was something of Antaeus in that pygmy; for the gaminto touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;Gavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sittingposture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both armsin the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and beganto sing:      "Je suis tombe par terre,     "I have fallen to the earth,       C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;       Le nez dans le ruisseau,      With my nose in the gutter,       C'est la faute a . . . "      'Tis the fault of . . . "He did not finish. A second bullet from the same marksman stopped himshort. This time he fell face downward on the pavement, and moved nomore. This grand little soul had taken its flight.CHAPTER XVI--HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHERAt that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for the gaze ofthe drama must be everywhere present,--two children were holding eachother by the hand. One might have been seven years old, the other five.The rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths onthe sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale andragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: "I amvery hungry."The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading hisbrother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates hadbeen closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. Thetroops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies ofcombat.How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from someguard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, atthe Barriere d'Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in theneighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read:Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum, some mountebank's booth from whichthey had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, escaped theeye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing, and hadpassed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read thepapers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed free. To beastray and to seem free is to be lost. These poor little creatures were,in fact, lost.These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put tosome trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thenardiers,leased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leavesfallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the ground bythe wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day, andwhich had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had beenconverted into rags.Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as "Abandonedchildren," whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find againon the pavements of Paris.It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for thesemiserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendentshad caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poorlittle things do not enter public gardens; still, people should reflectthat, as children, they have a right to flowers.These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were therecontrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and therethey remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversightis supposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and theinspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with theoutside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had notseen the two delinquents.It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. Butin June, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it canhardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, insummer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period ofthe solstice, the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. Ittakes everything. It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itselfwith a sort of suction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A showeris but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In themorning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is powderedover.Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain andwiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens andmeadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, becomeperfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors atonce. Everything smiles, sings and offers itself. One feels gentlyintoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps manto have patience.There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, havingthe azure of heaven, say: "It is enough!" dreamers absorbed in thewonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good andevil, contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do notunderstand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these,and the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter, with thelymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the pallet, theattic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls, when theycan dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits they, andpitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. Thatgreat need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore.The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do notthink about. The indefinite, which is born from the human and divinecombination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them. Provided thatthey are face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasyforever. Their life lies in surrendering their personality incontemplation. The history of humanity is for them only a detailedplan. All is not there; the true All remains without; what is the useof busying oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that is quitepossible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more milk, thenew-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but just look at thiswonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents underthe microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if youcan! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them to sucha point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child. God eclipsestheir souls. This is a family of minds which are, at once, great andpetty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La Fontaine perhaps;magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow, whodo not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun conceals thefuneral pile, who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in thesearch for an effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, northe death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, sincethere is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds of purpleand gold above their heads, declare themselves content, and who aredetermined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs ofthe birds are exhausted.These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to bepitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. Theyare to be admired and pitied, as one would both pity and admire a beingat once night and day, without eyes beneath his lashes but with a staron his brow.The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superiorphilosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is someinfirmity. One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One maybe more than man and less than man. There is incomplete immensity innature. Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?But then, what? In whom can we trust? Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?Who shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses,themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? Thatwhich is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that whichsends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, seesnot at all? Is not this a desperate state of things? No. But what isthere, then, above the sun? The god.On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning, theLuxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes andflower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. Thebranches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoringto embrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrowstriumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administeringlittle pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimateroyalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that whichemanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations wasperceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the talltrees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips,which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers. Allaround the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers,hummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse,by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined toprofit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged in thecharming threat of flying low. He who was there aspired to happiness;life smelled good; all nature exhaled candor, help, assistance,paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which fell from heaven were assweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it.The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow piercedwith light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; rays hungfrom them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth was alreadydried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze toraise little insurrections of dust here and there. A few yellow leaves,left over from the autumn, chased each other merrily, and seemed to beplaying tricks on each other.This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it.Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath creation,of the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths permeated withlove, in this interchange of reverberations and reflections, in thismarvellous expenditure of rays, in this infinite outpouring of liquidgold, one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible; and, behind thissplendor as behind a curtain of flame, one caught a glimpse of God, thatmillionaire of stars.Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,there was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just beenbathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springsfrom the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. Thismagnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled thegarden. A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts ofmusic, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings ofthe breeze. All the harmony of the season was complete in one graciouswhole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order; thelilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some insectsin advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June butterfliesfraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. Theplantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed outundulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. Itwas splendid. A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazingthrough the fence, said: "Here is the Spring presenting arms and in fulluniform."All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour;the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green clothon earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was servingthe universal repast. Each creature had his pasture or his mess. Thering-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, thegoldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finchfound flies, the fly found infusoriae, the bee found flowers. They ateeach other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed withgood; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of thegrand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried tohide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presenceof even impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans' hutch.Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sortof tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows, whichwere discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung overthe roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the air ofan appeal, was ringing in the distance.These children did not appear to notice these noises. The little onerepeated from time to time: "I am hungry."Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approachedthe great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a fatherand his son. The little man of six had a big brioche.At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madameand d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgersenjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which wassuppressed later on. This father and son came from one of these houses,no doubt.The two poor little creatures watched "that gentleman" approaching, andhid themselves a little more thoroughly.He was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one dayheard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counsellinghis son "to avoid excesses." He had an affable and haughty air, and amouth which was always smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanicalsmile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teethrather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitteninto but had not finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was dressedas a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the father hadremained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans.He resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principaltalent, and they were superb.If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of anage to understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave man.The father was saying to his son:"The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do not lovepomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; Ileave that false splendor to badly organized souls."Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Hallesburst out with fresh force of bell and uproar."What is that?" inquired the child.The father replied:"It is the Saturnalia."All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind thegreen swan-hutch."There is the beginning," said he.And, after a pause, he added:"Anarchy is entering this garden."In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,suddenly burst out crying."What are you crying about?" demanded his father."I am not hungry any more," said the child.The father's smile became more accentuated."One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.""My cake tires me. It is stale.""Don't you want any more of it?""No."The father pointed to the swans."Throw it to those palmipeds."The child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his cake; butthat is no reason for giving it away.The father went on:"Be humane. You must have compassion on animals."And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.The cake fell very near the edge.The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with someprey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, andmoved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic agitation,which finally attracted the attention of the swans.They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, asthey are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with thestupid majesty which befits white creatures."The swans [cygnes] understand signs [signes]," said the bourgeois,delighted to make a jest.At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another suddenincrease. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts of wind whichspeak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at thatmoment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, andthe dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with ablack cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.The swans had not yet reached the brioche."Let us return home," said the father, "they are attacking theTuileries."He grasped his son's hand again. Then he continued:"From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance whichseparates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soonrain down."He glanced at the cloud."Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the skyis joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return homequickly.""I should like to see the swans eat the brioche," said the child.The father replied:"That would be imprudent."And he led his little bourgeois away.The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basinuntil a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche atthe same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller ofthem stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois.Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grandflight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastilyflung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, andclinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on theverge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his sticktowards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in sodoing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service tothe little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, and one ofthese gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towardsthe child's wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake.The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened away theswans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet;but they were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into twoportions, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself,gave the large one to his brother, and said to him:"Ram that into your muzzle."CHAPTER XVII--MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTATMarius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. But hewas too late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back the basket ofcartridges; Marius bore the child."Alas!" he thought, "that which the father had done for his father, hewas requiting to the son; only, Thenardier had brought back his fatheralive; he was bringing back the child dead."When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, his face,like the child, was inundated with blood.At the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had grazedhis head; he had not noticed it.Courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged Marius' brow.They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over thetwo corpses the black shawl. There was enough of it for both the old manand the child.Combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he hadbrought in.This gave each man fifteen rounds to fire.Jean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his stone post.When Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges, he shook his head."Here's a rare eccentric," said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras."He finds a way of not fighting in this barricade.""Which does not prevent him from defending it," responded Enjolras."Heroism has its originals," resumed Combeferre.And Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added:"He is another sort from Father Mabeuf."One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering thebarricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversedthe whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singularmoments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go andcome, they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard acombatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: "We are here asat a bachelor breakfast." The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, werepeat, seemed very calm within. All mutations and all phases had been,or were about to be, exhausted. The position, from critical, had becomemenacing, and, from menacing, was probably about to become desperate. Inproportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism empurpledthe barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it,in the attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to thesombre genius, Epidotas.Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet andFeuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up byGavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: "We are soonto take the diligence for another planet"; Courfeyrac was disposing andarranging on some paving-stones which he had reserved for himself nearEnjolras, a complete arsenal, his sword-cane, his gun, two holsterpistols, and a cudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a smalldunkerque in order. Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall oppositehim. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup's big straw hat on hishead with a string, "for fear of sun-stroke," as he said. The youngmen from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves,as though eager to speak patois for the last time. Joly, who had takenWidow Hucheloup's mirror from the wall, was examining his tongue in it.Some combatants, having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread,in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. Marius was disturbed withregard to what his father was about to say to him.CHAPTER XVIII--THE VULTURE BECOME PREYWe must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades.Nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streetsshould be omitted.Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we havejust mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains,none the less, a vision.There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of theunknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes,and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed adream.The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed outin the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are bothmore and less than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no longerknows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one knowsit not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had humanfaces; one's head has been in the light of the future. There werecorpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours werecolossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadowshave passed by. What were they?One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafeninghorror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths whichshouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in themidst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched thesinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on one'sfinger nails. One no longer remembers anything.Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clockstriking the hour became audible."It is midday," said Combeferre.The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to hisfeet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout:"Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and theroofs with them. Half the men to their guns, the other half to thepaving-stones. There is not a minute to be lost."A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made theirappearance in battle array at the end of the street.This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? Theattacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition ofthe barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M.Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called "the tug of war."Enjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiarto ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escapeis impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones whichEnjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up tothe first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had elapsed,these stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled up thesash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half theirheight. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principalarchitect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament ofthe windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing ofgrape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging ballagainst the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, ifpossible, a breach for the assault.When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolrashad the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay,carried to the first floor."Who is to drink that?" Bossuet asked him."They," replied Enjolras.Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the ironcross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shopwas the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up theoutlet.As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing oftheir ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailantscombine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, exposethemselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more than inreality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are alwaysmade with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, the lightningstrikes.This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything andto perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, theirdeath ought to be a masterpiece.He said to Marius: "We are the two leaders. I will give the last ordersinside. Do you remain outside and observe."Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as thereader will remember, nailed up."No splashing of the wounded," he said.He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundlytranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all."On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase.Have you them?""Yes," said Feuilly."How many?""Two axes and a pole-axe.""That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. Howmany guns are there?""Thirty-four.""Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and athand. Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. Sixambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor tofire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not asingle worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats theassault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The first toarrive will have the best places."These arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:"I am not forgetting you."And, laying a pistol on the table, he added:"The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy.""Here?" inquired a voice."No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade ofthe Mondetour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man iswell pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death."There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras,it was Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.He had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth andsaid to Enjolras:"You are the commander?""Yes.""You thanked me a while ago.""In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, MariusPontmercy and yourself.""Do you think that I deserve a recompense?""Certainly.""Well, I request one.""What is it?""That I may blow that man's brains out."Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptiblemovement, and said:"That is just."As for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyesabout him:"No objections."And he turned to Jean Valjean:"Take the spy."Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seatinghimself on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint clickannounced that he had cocked it.Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible."Take care!" shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar tohim, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:"You are in no better case than I am.""All out!" shouted Enjolras.The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received inthe back,--may we be permitted the expression,--this sally of Javert's:"We shall meet again shortly!"CHAPTER XIX--JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGEWhen Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope whichfastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot ofwhich was under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise.Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy ofenchained authority is condensed.Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast ofburden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him, emergedfrom the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded limbs, couldtake only very short steps.Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. Theinsurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had theirbacks turned to these two.Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of thebarricade, saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner wasilluminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.Jean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold fora single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the littleentrenchment in the Mondetour lane.When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in thelane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a lividface, streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of awoman. It was Eponine. The corner of the houses hid them from theinsurgents. The corpses carried away from the barricade formed aterrible pile a few paces distant.Javert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in a lowtone:"It strikes me that I know that girl."Then he turned to Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a lookwhich it required no words to interpret: "Javert, it is I."Javert replied:"Take your revenge."Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it."A clasp-knife!" exclaimed Javert, "you are right. That suits youbetter."Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then hecut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on hisfeet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him:"You are free."Javert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself thoughhe was, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed andmotionless.Jean Valjean continued:"I do not think that I shall escape from this place. But if, by chance,I do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l'HommeArme, No. 7."Javert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner of hismouth, and he muttered between his teeth:"Have a care.""Go," said Jean Valjean.Javert began again:"Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l'Homme Arme?""Number 7."Javert repeated in a low voice:--"Number 7."He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffnessbetween his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and, supportinghis chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction of the Halles.Jean Valjean followed him with his eyes:A few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean:"You annoy me. Kill me, rather."Javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjeanas "thou.""Be off with you," said Jean Valjean.Javert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Ruedes Precheurs.When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.Then he returned to the barricade and said:"It is done."In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up tothat time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark backgroundof the tap-room.When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade inorder to proceed to his death, he recognized him. Something suddenlyrecurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise,and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he,Marius, had used in this very barricade, and not only did he recall hisface, but his name as well.This recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas.It was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put tohimself:"Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name wasJavert?"Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But, inthe first place, he must know whether this was Javert.Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the otherextremity of the barricade:"Enjolras!""What?""What is the name of yonder man?""What man?""The police agent. Do you know his name?""Of course. He told us.""What is it?""Javert."Marius sprang to his feet.At that moment, they heard the report of the pistol.Jean Valjean re-appeared and cried: "It is done."A gloomy chill traversed Marius' heart.CHAPTER XX--THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THEWRONGThe death agony of the barricade was about to begin.Everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; athousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed masses setin movement in the streets which were not visible, the intermittentgallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery on the march, the firingby squads, and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinthof Paris, the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs,indescribable and vaguely terrible cries, lightnings of menaceeverywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now had the accents of asob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor of the sky filled withsun and clouds, the beauty of the day, and the alarming silence of thehouses.For, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Ruede la Chanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed,windows closed, shutters closed.In those days, so different from those in which we live, when the hourwas come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, which hadlasted too long, with a charter granted or with a legal country, whenuniversal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere, when the city consentedto the tearing up of the pavements, when insurrection made thebourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear, then theinhabitant, thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, so to speak, wasthe auxiliary of the combatant, and the house fraternized with theimprovised fortress which rested on it. When the situation was notripe, when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the massesdisowned the movement, all was over with the combatants, the city waschanged into a desert around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refugeswere nailed up, and the street turned into a defile to help the army totake the barricade.A people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly thanit chooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does notlet itself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to itself.The insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. A house is anescarpment, a door is a refusal, a facade is a wall. This wall hears,sees and will not. It might open and save you. No. This wall is a judge.It gazes at you and condemns you. What dismal things are closed houses.They seem dead, they are living. Life which is, as it were, suspendedthere, persists there. No one has gone out of them for four and twentyhours, but no one is missing from them. In the interior of that rock,people go and come, go to bed and rise again; they are a family partythere; there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! Fearexcuses this fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed with it, anextenuating circumstance. Sometimes, even, and this has been actuallyseen, fear turns to passion; fright may change into fury, as prudencedoes into rage; hence this wise saying: "The enraged moderates." Thereare outbursts of supreme terror, whence springs wrath like a mournfulsmoke.--"What do these people want? What have they come there to do?Let them get out of the scrape. So much the worse for them. It is theirfault. They are only getting what they deserve. It does not concernus. Here is our poor street all riddled with balls. They are a pack ofrascals. Above all things, don't open the door."--And the house assumesthe air of a tomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes in front ofthat house; he sees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; ifhe cries, he knows that they are listening to him, and that no one willcome; there stand walls which might protect him, there are men who mightsave him; and these walls have ears of flesh, and these men have bowelsof stone.Whom shall he reproach?No one and every one.The incomplete times in which we live.It is always at its own risk and peril that Utopia is converted intorevolution, and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest, andfrom Minerva turns to Pallas.The Utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaitsit; it almost always comes too soon. Then it becomes resigned, andstoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph. It serves those whodeny it without complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpatesthem, and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. It isindomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.Is this ingratitude, however?Yes, from the point of view of the human race.No, from the point of view of the individual.Progress is man's mode of existence. The general life of the human raceis called Progress, the collective stride of the human race is calledProgress. Progress advances; it makes the great human and terrestrialjourney towards the celestial and the divine; it has its haltingplaces where it rallies the laggard troop, it has its stations where itmeditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiledon its horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; and it is one of thepoignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on thehuman soul, and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awakenthat slumbering Progress."God is dead, perhaps," said Gerard de Nerval one day to the writer ofthese lines, confounding progress with God, and taking the interruptionof movement for the death of Being.He who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, inshort, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep, for it hasincreased in size. When we behold it erect once more, we find it taller.To be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it doeson the stream; erect no barriers, cast in no boulders; obstacles makewater froth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but after thesetroubles, we recognize the fact that ground has been gained. Untilorder, which is nothing else than universal peace, has been established,until harmony and unity reign, progress will have revolutions as itshalting-places.What, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent lifeof the peoples.Now, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals offersresistance to the eternal life of the human race.Let us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinctinterests, and can, without forfeiture, stipulate for his interest, anddefend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; momentarylife has its rights, and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly tothe future. The generation which is passing in its turn over the earth,is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations, its equal,after all, who will have their turn later on.--"I exist," murmurs thatsome one whose name is All. "I am young and in love, I am old and Iwish to repose, I am the father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I amsuccessful in business, I have houses to lease, I have money in thegovernment funds, I am happy, I have a wife and children, I have allthis, I desire to live, leave me in peace."--Hence, at certain hours, aprofound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.Utopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when it makeswar. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle,from the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It,pure idea, becomes a deed of violence. It complicates its heroism witha violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer; aviolence of occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for whichit is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the oldmilitary code in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors; itsuppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It makesuse of death, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no longerany faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force. Itstrikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has twoedges; he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.Having made this reservation, and made it with all severity, it isimpossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not, those theglorious combatants of the future, the confessors of Utopia. Even whenthey miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; and it is, perhaps, infailure, that they possess the most majesty. Victory, when it is inaccord with progress, merits the applause of the people; but a heroicdefeat merits their tender compassion. The one is magnificent, the othersublime. For our own part, we prefer martyrdom to success. John Brown isgreater than Washington, and Pisacane is greater than Garibaldi.It certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of thevanquished.We are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, when theyfail.Revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad. Every barricade seemsa crime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, theirulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. They arereproached with raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the reigningsocial state, a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities, of wrongs,of despairs, and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadowin order therein to embattle themselves and to combat. People shoutto them: "You are tearing up the pavements of hell!" They might reply:"That is because our barricade is made of good intentions."The best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, let usagree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, and it isa good will which renders society uneasy. But it depends on societyto save itself, it is to its own good will that we make our appeal.No violent remedy is necessary. To study evil amiably, to prove itsexistence, then to cure it. It is to this that we invite it.However that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men,who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France, arestriving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal,are august; they give their life a free offering to progress; theyaccomplish the will of providence; they perform a religious act. At theappointed hour, with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answersto his cue, in obedience to the divine stage-manager, they enter thetomb. And this hopeless combat, this stoical disappearance they acceptin order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences, themagnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the 14th of July,1789; these soldiers are priests. The French revolution is an act ofGod.Moreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to thedistinctions already pointed out in another chapter,--there are acceptedrevolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there are refusedrevolutions, which are called riots.An insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing itsexamination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball, theidea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.Waging war at every summons and every time that Utopia desires it, isnot the thing for the peoples. Nations have not always and at every hourthe temperament of heroes and martyrs.They are positive. A priori, insurrection is repugnant to them, in thefirst place, because it often results in a catastrophe, in the secondplace, because it always has an abstraction as its point of departure.Because, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and forthe ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrificethemselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;hence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at agovernment or a regime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and weinsist upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, inparticular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie werecombating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them,when talking freely, did justice to this king who stood midway betweenmonarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the youngerbranch of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had attacked itselder branch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to overturn inoverturning royalty in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpationof man over man, and of privilege over right in the entire universe.Paris without a king has as result the world without despots. This isthe manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was distant no doubt,vague perhaps, and it retreated in the face of their efforts; but it wasgreat.Thus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which arealmost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which,after all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselvesinto these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we areabout to do. Who knows? We may succeed. We are few in number, we have awhole army arrayed against us; but we are defending right, the naturallaw, the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdicationis possible, justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like thethree hundred Spartans. We do not think of Don Quixote but of Leonidas.And we march straight before us, and once pledged, we do not drawback, and we rush onwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope anunprecedented victory, revolution completed, progress set free again,the aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance; and in theevent of the worst, Thermopylae.These passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,and we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the presence ofthe impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes which are fragilebecause of their very weight, fear adventures; and there is a touch ofadventure in the ideal.Moreover, and we must not forget this, interests which are not veryfriendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. Sometimes thestomach paralyzes the heart.The grandeur and beauty of France lies in this, that she takes less fromthe stomach than other nations: she more easily knots the rope about herloins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. She marches forwards.She is a seeker.This arises from the fact that she is an artist.The ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic, the same as thebeautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. Artistic peoples arealso consistent peoples. To love beauty is to see the light. That is whythe torch of Europe, that is to say of civilization, was first borne byGreece, who passed it on to Italy, who handed it on to France. Divine,illuminating nations of scouts! Vitaelampada tradunt.It is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element ofits progress. The amount of civilization is measured by the quantityof imagination. Only, a civilizing people should remain a manly people.Corinth, yes; Sybaris, no. Whoever becomes effeminate makes himself abastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso: but he must beartistic. In the matter of civilization, he must not refine, but he mustsublime. On this condition, one gives to the human race the pattern ofthe ideal.The modern ideal has its type in art, and its means is science. It isthrough science that it will realize that august vision of the poets,the socially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed by A+B. At the pointwhich civilization has now reached, the exact is a necessary elementof the splendid, and the artistic sentiment is not only served, butcompleted by the scientific organ; dreams must be calculated. Art, whichis the conqueror, should have for support science, which is the walker;the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance. Themodern spirit is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as itsvehicle; Alexander on the elephant.Races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit toguide civilization. Genuflection before the idol or before money wastesaway the muscles which walk and the will which advances. Hieratic ormercantile absorption lessens a people's power of radiance, lowers itshorizon by lowering its level, and deprives it of that intelligence,at once both human and divine of the universal goal, which makesmissionaries of nations. Babylon has no ideal; Carthage has no ideal.Athens and Rome have and keep, throughout all the nocturnal darkness ofthe centuries, halos of civilization.France is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. She isAthenian in the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. Moreover,she is good. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case with otherraces, is she in the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. Only, thishumor seizes upon her, and again abandons her. And therein lies thegreat peril for those who run when she desires only to walk, or who walkon when she desires to halt. France has her relapses into materialism,and, at certain instants, the ideas which obstruct that sublime brainhave no longer anything which recalls French greatness and are of thedimensions of a Missouri or a South Carolina. What is to be done insuch a case? The giantess plays at being a dwarf; immense France has herfreaks of pettiness. That is all.To this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess theright to an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the lightreturns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night. Dawn andresurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is identicalwith the persistence of the _I_.Let us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade or the tomb inexile, is an acceptable occasion for devotion. The real name ofdevotion is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned allow themselves tobe abandoned, let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled, and let usconfine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far,when they do retreat. One must not push too far in descent under pretextof a return to reason.Matter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists;but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment hasits rights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. Alas! thefact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall. This can be seen inhistory more frequently than is desirable: A nation is great, it tastesthe ideal, then it bites the mire, and finds it good; and if it be askedhow it happens that it has abandoned Socrates for Falstaff, it replies:"Because I love statesmen."One word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.A battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing elsethan a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled is sickly, andis subject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady of progress,civil war, we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage. Thisis one of the fatal phases, at once act and entr'acte of that dramawhose pivot is a social condemnation, and whose veritable title isProgress.Progress!The cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought; and,at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea which itcontains having still more than one trial to undergo, it is, perhaps,permitted to us, if not to lift the veil from it, to at least allow itslight to shine through.The book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, fromone end to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may be itsintermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil to good, fromthe unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite to conscience,from rottenness to life, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God.Point of departure: matter; point of arrival: the soul. The hydra at thebeginning, the angel at the end.CHAPTER XXI--THE HEROESAll at once, the drum beat the charge.The attack was a hurricane. On the evening before, in the darkness,the barricade had been approached silently, as by a boa. Now, in broaddaylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible,rude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun theroar, the army hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill.A powerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regularintervals, by the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot,and supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen,debauched into the street at a run, with drums beating, trumpetsbraying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head, and,imperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight for the barricadewith the weight of a brazen beam against a wall.The wall held firm.The insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade once scaled had a maneof lightning flashes. The assault was so furious, that for one moment,it was inundated with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as thelion shakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers asthe cliff is covered with foam, to re-appear, a moment later, beetling,black and formidable.The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street,unprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terribledischarge of musketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall thesheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. Letthe reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical buthorizontal, bearing a bullet, buck-shot or a biscaien at the tip of eachone of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men one after anotherfrom its clusters of lightning. The barricade was underneath it.On both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited therewas almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocitywhich began by the sacrifice of self.This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave.The troop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous offighting. The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth andin the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this fray, eachone underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. The street wasstrewn with corpses.The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at theother. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reservedand sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, underhis embrasure, without having even seen him; Marius fought unprotected.He made himself a target. He stood with more than half his body abovethe breastworks. There is no more violent prodigal than the avariciousman who takes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible inaction than a dreamer. Marius was formidable and pensive. In battle hewas as in a dream. One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged infiring a gun.The insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. Inthis whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.Courfeyrac was bare-headed."What have you done with your hat?" Bossuet asked him.Courfeyrac replied:"They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls."Or they uttered haughty comments."Can any one understand," exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, "those men,--[andhe cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names, some belongingto the old army]--who had promised to join us, and taken an oath to aidus, and who had pledged their honor to it, and who are our generals, andwho abandon us!"And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile."There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes thestars, from a great distance."The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges thatone would have said that there had been a snowstorm.The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position.They were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank uponthe soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled inthe escarpment. This barricade, constructed as it was and admirablybuttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful of menhold a legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantlyrecruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorablynearer, and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the armyclosed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.One assault followed another. The horror of the situation keptincreasing.Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that Rue de laChanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. These haggard, ragged,exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours, whohad not slept, who had but a few more rounds to fire, who were fumblingin their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly allof whom were wounded, with head or arm bandaged with black andblood-stained linen, with holes in their clothes from which the bloodtrickled, and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords,became Titans. The barricade was ten times attacked, approached,assailed, scaled, and never captured.In order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to imaginefire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze at theconflagration. It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace;there mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.The human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forththere, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that redglow of those salamanders of the fray.The successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter werenounce all attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right to filltwelve thousand verses with a battle.One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the mostredoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls the Forest ofSwords.They fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows ofthe sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, from above,from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, from thewindows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, whither some hadcrawled. They were one against sixty.The facade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window,tattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass and frame and was nothing nowbut a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones.Bossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed;Combeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast atthe moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only time tocast a glance to heaven when he expired.Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in thehead, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one wouldhave said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.Enjolras alone was not struck. When he had no longer any weapon, hereached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some armor other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four swords;one more than Francois I. at Marignan. Homer says: "Diomedes cutsthe throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy Arisba;Euryalus, son of Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios,Esepius, and that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blamelessBucolion; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus;Polypaetes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon.Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike. Agamemnon, kingof the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city whichis laved by the sounding river Satnois." In our old poems of exploits,Esplandian attacks the giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler'sshoulder-stick of fire, and the latter defends himself by stoning thehero with towers which he plucks up by the roots. Our ancient muralfrescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne and Bourbon, armed,emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, on horseback and approachingeach other, their battle-axes in hand, masked with iron, gloved withiron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned in ermine, the other drapedin azure: Bretagne with his lion between the two horns of his crown,Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor. But, in orderto be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion,to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles,father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit ofmail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to giveone's life for a conviction or a loyalty. This ingenuous littlesoldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with hisclasp-knife by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourggarden, this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book,a blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them,breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in theCarrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and let theone fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both ofthem imagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle willbe colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbonesin conflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanityis striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, King of Lycia,tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal tothe gods.CHAPTER XXII--FOOT TO FOOTWhen there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, except Enjolrasand Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, the centre, whichhad so long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet, Feuilly and Combeferre,gave way. The cannon, though it had not effected a practicable breach,had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt; there, thesummit of the wall had disappeared before the balls, and had crumbledaway; and the rubbish which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had,as it accumulated, formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the twosides of the barrier, one on the inside, the other on the outside. Theexterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack.A final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. Themass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run, came up withirresistible force, and the serried front of battle of the attackingcolumn made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of thebattlements. This time, it was decisive. The group of insurgents whowere defending the centre retreated in confusion.Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many,finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did notwish to die. This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservationemits howls, when the beast re-appears in men. They were hemmed in bythe lofty, six-story house which formed the background of their redoubt.This house might prove their salvation. The building was barricaded, andwalled, as it were, from top to bottom. Before the troops of the linehad reached the interior of the redoubt, there was time for a door toopen and shut, the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient forthat, and the door of that house, suddenly opened a crack and closedagain instantly, was life for these despairing men. Behind this house,there were streets, possible flight, space. They set to knocking at thatdoor with the butts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling,entreating, wringing their hands. No one opened. From the little windowon the third floor, the head of the dead man gazed down upon them.But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them,sprang forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers:"Don't advance!" and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras had killedthe officer. He was now in the little inner court of the redoubt, withhis back planted against the Corinthe building, a sword in one hand,a rifle in the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which hebarred against assailants. He shouted to the desperate men:--"There isbut one door open; this one."--And shielding them with his body, andfacing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. Allprecipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle,which he now used like a cane, what single-stick players call a "coveredrose" round his head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him,and was the last to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when thesoldiers tried to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to barthem out. The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell backinto its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had beenclinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.Marius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, hefelt that he was fainting and falling. At that moment, with eyes alreadyshut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the swoonin which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time for the thought,mingled with a last memory of Cosette:--"I am taken prisoner. I shall beshot."Enjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in thewine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when eachman has not the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed thebar across the door, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key andchain, while those outside were battering furiously at it, the soldierswith the butts of their muskets, the sappers with their axes. Theassailants were grouped about that door. The siege of the wine-shop wasnow beginning.The soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath.The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a stillmore melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had precededthe attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents weremutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body ofa soldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usualaccompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this kindwhich, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:"Let us sell our lives dearly."Then he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Beneaththe black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large,the other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath thecold folds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath the windingsheet and hung near the floor. It was that of the old man.Enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, just as he had kissedhis brow on the preceding evening.These were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course ofhis life.Let us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of Thebes;the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These resistances aredogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. Men are willing to die,provided their opponent will kill them.When Suchet says:--"Capitulate,"--Palafox replies: "After the war withcannon, the war with knives." Nothing was lacking in the capture byassault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining fromthe windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiersby crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows andthe cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door yielded,the frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into thewine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had beenbeaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single combatant there.The spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle ofthe tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, everyone who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, throughthe hole in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs,a terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. Whenthey were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death hadno longer either powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of thebottles which Enjolras had reserved, and of which we have spoken, andheld the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs.They were bottles of aquafortis.We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. Thebesieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire didnot disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All waris a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of thebesiegers, though confined and embarrassed by being directed from belowupwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedilysurrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smokingstreams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almostproduced night over this combat. Words are lacking to express horrorwhen it has reached this pitch. There were no longer men in thisconflict, which was now infernal. They were no longer giants matchedwith colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demonsattacked, spectres resisted.It was heroism become monstrous.CHAPTER XXIII--ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNKAt length, by dint of mounting on each other's backs, aiding themselveswith the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging tothe ceiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the lastone who offered resistance, a score of assailants, soldiers, NationalGuardsmen, municipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majoritydisfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent, blindedby blood, furious, rendered savage, made an irruption into the apartmenton the first floor. There they found only one man still on his feet,Enjolras. Without cartridges, without sword, he had nothing in his handnow but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the headof those who were entering. He had placed the billiard table between hisassailants and himself; he had retreated into the corner of the room,and there, with haughty eye, and head borne high, with this stump of aweapon in his hand, he was still so alarming as to speedily create anempty space around him. A cry arose:"He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is well thathe has placed himself there. Let him remain there. Let us shoot him downon the spot.""Shoot me," said Enjolras.And flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, and folding his arms, heoffered his breast.The audacity of a fine death always affects men. As soon as Enjolrasfolded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased inthe room, and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchralsolemnity. The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless,appeared to oppress this tumult, and this young man, haughty, bloody,and charming, who alone had not a wound, who was as indifferent as aninvulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, toconstrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, atthat moment augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was freshand rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed,as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of him,possibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council ofwar: "There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo." A NationalGuardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered his gun, saying: "Itseems to me that I am about to shoot a flower."Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, andsilently made ready their guns.Then a sergeant shouted:"Take aim!"An officer intervened."Wait."And addressing Enjolras:"Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?""No.""Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?""Yes."Grantaire had waked up a few moments before.Grantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since thepreceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated on a chairand leaning on the table.He realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of "dead drunk." Thehideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown him into alethargy. His table being small, and not suitable for the barricade,he had been left in possession of it. He was still in the same posture,with his breast bent over the table, his head lying flat on his arms,surrounded by glasses, beer-jugs and bottles. His was the overwhelmingslumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had had anyeffect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor thegrape-shot which had made its way through the window into the room wherehe was. Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely replied tothe cannonade, now and then, by a snore. He seemed to be waiting therefor a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. Many corpseswere strewn around him; and, at the first glance, there was nothing todistinguish him from those profound sleepers of death.Noise does not rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him. The fallof everything around him only augmented Grantaire's prostration; thecrumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which thetumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this heavyslumber. It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, whichsuddenly comes to a dead stop. The persons dozing within it wake up.Grantaire rose to his feet with a start, stretched out his arms, rubbedhis eyes, stared, yawned, and understood.A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is tornaway. One beholds, at a single glance and as a whole, all that it hasconcealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; and the drunkardwho has known nothing of what has been taking place during the lasttwenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectlyinformed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; the obliterationof intoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured the brain, isdissipated, and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunityof realities.Relegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind thebilliard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had noteven noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing to repeat hisorder: "Take aim!" when all at once, they heard a strong voice shoutbeside them:"Long live the Republic! I'm one of them."Grantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat which hehad missed, and in which he had had no part, appeared in the brilliantglance of the transfigured drunken man.He repeated: "Long live the Republic!" crossed the room with a firmstride and placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras."Finish both of us at one blow," said he.And turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him:"Do you permit it?"Enjolras pressed his hand with a smile.This smile was not ended when the report resounded.Enjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall,as though the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed.Grantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt.A few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaininginsurgents, who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They firedinto the attic through a wooden lattice. They fought under the veryroof. They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through thewindows. Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus,were slain by two shots fired from the attic. A man in a blouse wasflung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and breathedhis last on the ground. A soldier and an insurgent slipped togetheron the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would not release eachother, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace. A similar conflictwent on in the cellar. Shouts, shots, a fierce trampling. Then silence.The barricade was captured.The soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue thefugitives.CHAPTER XXIV--PRISONERMarius was, in fact, a prisoner.The hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had feltat the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of JeanValjean.Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to exposehimself in it. Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme phaseof agony, would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, everywherepresent in the carnage, like a providence, those who fell were pickedup, transported to the tap-room, and cared for. In the intervals, hereappeared on the barricade. But nothing which could resemble a blow,an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands. He held hispeace and lent succor. Moreover he had received only a few scratches.The bullets would have none of him. If suicide formed part of what hehad meditated on coming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he hadnot succeeded. But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, anirreligious act.Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to seeMarius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. Whena shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the agility ofa tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and bore him off.The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violentlyconcentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, thatno one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms,traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind theangle of the Corinthe building.The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on thestreet; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, and alleyes, and a few square feet of space. There is sometimes a chamberwhich does not burn in the midst of a conflagration, and in the midst ofraging seas, beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alleyof shoals, a tranquil nook. It was in this sort of fold in the interiortrapezium of the barricade, that Eponine had breathed her last.There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, placed hisback against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.The situation was alarming.For an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall was ashelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled theanguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight years before,and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape; it was difficultthen, to-day it was impossible. He had before him that deaf andimplacable house, six stories in height, which appeared to be inhabitedonly by a dead man leaning out of his window; he had on his right therather low barricade, which shut off the Rue de la Petite Truanderie;to pass this obstacle seemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier aline of bayonets was visible. The troops of the line were posted on thewatch behind that barricade. It was evident, that to pass the barricadewas to go in quest of the fire of the platoon, and that any head whichshould run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall ofstones would serve as a target for sixty shots. On his left he had thefield of battle. Death lurked round the corner of that wall.What was to be done?Only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some expedient,to come to some decision. Fighting was going on a few paces away;fortunately, all were raging around a single point, the door of thewine-shop; but if it should occur to one soldier, to one single soldier,to turn the corner of the house, or to attack him on the flank, all wasover.Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the barricade atone side of him, then he looked at the ground, with the violence of thelast extremity, bewildered, and as though he would have liked to piercea hole there with his eyes.By dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony beganto assume form and outline at his feet, as though it had been a powerof glance which made the thing desired unfold. A few paces distant heperceived, at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded andwatched on the exterior, beneath a disordered mass of paving-stoneswhich partly concealed it, an iron grating, placed flat and on a levelwith the soil. This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was abouttwo feet square. The frame of paving-stones which supported it had beentorn up, and it was, as it were, unfastened.Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something likethe flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean dartedforward. His old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination.To thrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift Marius, whowas as inert as a dead body, upon his shoulders, to descend, with thisburden on his loins, and with the aid of his elbows and knees into thatsort of well, fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, uponwhich the loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behindhim, to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below thesurface,--all this was executed like that which one does in dreams, withthe strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took only afew minutes.Jean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, in asort of long, subterranean corridor.There reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from thewall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was carrying to-daywas not Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely hear the formidabletumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault, like a vague murmur overhead.BOOK SECOND.--THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHANCHAPTER I--THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEAParis casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this withoutmetaphor. How, and in what manner? Day and night. With what object? Withno object. With what intention? With no intention. Why? For noreason. By means of what organ? By means of its intestine. What is itsintestine? The sewer.Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which thevaluations of special science have set upon it.Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the mostfecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure.The Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. Nota Chinese peasant--it is Eckberg who says this,--goes to town withoutbringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, twofull buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, theearth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinesewheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparablein fertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the mostmighty of dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experimentof employing the city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, ourmanure, on the other hand, is gold.What is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss.Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dungof petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable elementof opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human andanimal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead ofbeing cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world.Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud whichjolt through the street by night, those terrible casks of the streetdepartment, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which thepavements hide from you,--do you know what they are? They are the meadowin flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game,they are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in theevening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are thebread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they arehealth, they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that mysteriouscreation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven.Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth fromit. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.You have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider meridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.Statisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit ofhalf a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of herrivers. Note this: with five hundred millions we could pay one quarterof the expenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that heprefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It isthe very substance of the people that is carried off, here drop bydrop, there wave after wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into therivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean. Everyhiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs. From this spring tworesults, the land impoverished, and the water tainted. Hunger arisingfrom the furrow, and disease from the stream.It is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames ispoisoning London.So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, totransport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the last bridge.A double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, sucking upand driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the lungsof a man, and which is already in full working order in many communitiesin England, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields intoour cities, and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities,and this easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would retain among usthe five hundred millions now thrown away. People are thinking of otherthings.The process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good.The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge thecity, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. A seweris a mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its double function,restoring what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is asimple impoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the dataof a now social economy, the product of the earth will be increasedtenfold, and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened. Add thesuppression of parasitism, and it will be solved.In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and leakagetakes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in this mannerby exhaustion.As for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains onetwenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano beingthe richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss onthe part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard whichFrance annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed inassistance and enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. Thecity spends them in sewers. So that we may say that Paris's greatprodigality, its wonderful festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, itsstream of gold from full hands, its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence,is its sewer system.It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political economy,we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs thewell-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the publicfortune.Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris isa spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arrangedcapitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, thatmetropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, ofimpulse and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, thatnation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination ofBabylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug hisshoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated.Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Parisis itself an imitator.These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is noyoung folly. The ancients did like the moderns. "The sewers of Rome,"says Liebig, "have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant."When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhaustedItaly, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily,then Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world.This cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe. Urbiet orbi. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar tointelligent towns.For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we havejust explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Parisof sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, its squares, itsblind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire andminus the human form.For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where thereis everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and,if Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might,Sparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it alsocontains Lutetia, the city of mud.However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink ofParis realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in humanityby some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose vileness.The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, wouldpresent the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no morepartitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of sixleagues round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not tomention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mentionthe inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vasttubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in thepillar fountains, the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-workunder the two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guidingthread.There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product towhich Paris has given birth.CHAPTER II--ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWERLet the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterraneannet-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will outline on the banksa species of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, thebelt sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary ducts willform the branches, and those without exit the twigs.This figure is but a summary one and half exact, the right angle, whichis the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications,being very rare in vegetation.A more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formedby supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet,as intricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, and themisshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion,and as at haphazard, now by their angles, again by their extremities.Sinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in the LowerEmpire and in the Orient of old. The masses regarded these beds ofdecomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that wasalmost religious. The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive togiddiness than the lions' ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, accordingto the rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from thesewer of Munster that John of Leyden produced his false moon, and itwas from the cess-pool of Kekscheb that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, theveiled prophet of Khorassan, caused his false sun to emerge.The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. TheGermoniae[58] narrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient andformidable thing. It has been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum.Crime, intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, thought,theft, all that human laws persecute or have persecuted, is hidden inthat hole; the maillotins in the fourteenth century, the tire-laine ofthe fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, Morin's illuminated inthe seventeenth, the chauffeurs [brigands] in the eighteenth. Ahundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, thepickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris hadits sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic picareria, accepted the sewer as theadjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at evening, it returned thither,fierce and sly, through the Maubuee outlet, as into a bed-chamber.It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset,[Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene oftheir daily labor, should have for their domicile by night the culvertof the Chemin-Vert, or the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng ofsouvenirs. All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitarycorridors; everywhere is putrescence and miasma; here and there arebreathing-holes, where Villon within converses with Rabelais without.The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions andof all attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, socialphilosophy there beholds a residuum.The sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there convergesand confronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, butthere are no longer any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or atleast, its definitive form. The mass of filth has this in its favor,that it is not a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The maskof Basil is to be found there, but one beholds its cardboard and itsstrings and the inside as well as the outside, and it is accentuatedby honest mud. Scapin's false nose is its next-door neighbor. All theuncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, fall into thistrench of truth, where the immense social sliding ends. They arethere engulfed, but they display themselves there. This mixture is aconfession. There, no more false appearances, no plastering over ispossible, filth removes its shirt, absolute denudation puts to the routall illusions and mirages, there is nothing more except what reallyexists, presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end.There, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handletells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which hasentertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; theeffigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas'spittle meets Falstaff's puking, the louis-d'or which comes fromthe gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope's end of thesuicide. A livid foetus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles whichdanced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronouncedjudgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerlyMargoton's petticoat; it is more than fraternization, it is equivalentto addressing each other as thou. All which was formerly rouged, iswashed free. The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic. It tellseverything.The sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one haspassed one's time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airswhich reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human justice,professional probity, the austerities of situation, incorruptible robesall assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire whichbefits it.This is instructive at the same time. We have just said that historypasses through the sewer. The Saint-Barthelemys filter through there,drop by drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations,political and religious butcheries, traverse this underground passageof civilization, and thrust their corpses there. For the eye of thethinker, all historic murderers are to be found there, in that hideouspenumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of their winding-sheet foran apron, dismally sponging out their work. Louis XI. is there withTristan, Francois I. with Duprat, Charles IX. is there with his mother,Richelieu is there with Louis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier isthere, Hebert and Maillard are there, scratching the stones, and tryingto make the traces of their actions disappear. Beneath these vaults onehears the brooms of spectres. One there breathes the enormous fetidnessof social catastrophes. One beholds reddish reflections in the corners.There flows a terrible stream, in which bloody hands have been washed.The social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part ofhis laboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everythingdesires to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation isuseless. What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the shamefulside. Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and doesnot permit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration of thingswhich disappear, in the watching of things which vanish, it recognizesall. It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman from thescrap of her dress. From the cess-pool, it re-constitutes the city; frommud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphoraor the jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, itrecognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengassefrom the Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-discovers in what remains thatwhich has been, good, evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace,the ink-blot of the cavern, the drop of sweat from the brothel, trialsundergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, the turn whichcharacters have taken as they became abased, the trace of prostitutionin souls of which their grossness rendered them capable, and on thevesture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina's elbowing.CHAPTER III--BRUNESEAUThe sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenthcentury, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred yearsago, the cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself,and fared as best it might.Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision,and to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, '89showed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times,the capital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its ownaffairs either morally or materially, and could not sweep out filthany better than it could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle,everything raised a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory toevery itinerary. One could no more find one's bearings in the sewerthan one could understand one's position in the city; above theunintelligible, below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of tonguesthere reigned the confusion of caverns; Daedalus backed up Babel.Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though thismisunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. Thereoccurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, thatstomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool flowed back intothe throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth.These resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; theywere warnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignantat the audacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth shouldreturn. Drive it out better.The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians ofthe age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place desVictoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the RueSaint-Honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Elysees,the Rue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the RuePierre-a-Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt,through the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, throughthe sewer of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue desChamps-Elysees to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, to theSouth, through the vent of the Seine, performing its functions ininverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l'Echaude, andthe Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a distance of one hundred andnine metres, a few paces distant from the house in which Racine hadlived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than theKing. It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, whereit rose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of thewater-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where itspread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty-eight metres in length.At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still amysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case itsevil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confusedway, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked of it asof that monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen longfeet in length, and which might have served Behemoth for a bathtub.The great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certainwell-known points. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger'scarts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquisde Crequi, discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As forcleaning out,--that function was entrusted to the pouring rains whichencumbered rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer,and called it the Gemoniae; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it thePolypus-Hole. Science and superstition were in accord, in horror. ThePolypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblinwas developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; thecorpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie;Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the greathiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 inthe Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger.The mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated forthe pestilences which had their source there; with its grating of iron,with points simulating a row of teeth, it was like a dragon's mawin that fatal street, breathing forth hell upon men. The popularimagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink with some indescribablyhideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewer had no bottom. The sewerwas the lower world. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did noteven occur to the police. To try that unknown thing, to cast the plummetinto that shadow, to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss--whowould have dared? It was alarming. Nevertheless, some one did presenthimself. The cess-pool had its Christopher Columbus.One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperormade in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decres or Cretet orother, came to the master's intimate levee. In the Carrousel there wasaudible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers ofthe great Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon's door wasblocked with heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from theAdige, and from the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau,of Hoche, of Kleber; the aerostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers ofMayence, the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids hadlooked down upon, artillerists whom Junot's cannon-ball had spatteredwith mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchorin the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi,others had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others hadpreceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. The whole army of thatday was present there, in the court-yard of the Tuileries, representedby a squadron or a platoon, and guarding Napoleon in repose; and thatwas the splendid epoch when the grand army had Marengo behind it andAusterlitz before it.--"Sire," said the Minister of the Interior toNapoleon, "yesterday I saw the most intrepid man in your Empire."--"Whatman is that?" said the Emperor brusquely, "and what has he done?"--"Hewants to do something, Sire."--"What is it?"--"To visit the sewers ofParis."This man existed and his name was Bruneseau.CHAPTER IV--BRUNESEAU.The visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battleagainst pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyageof discovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligentworkingman, who was very young at the time, related curious details withregard to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself obligedto omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of officialstyle. The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch, extremelyrudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations ofthat subterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refusedto go any further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed thenecessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the sametime, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the gratingsand the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate thecurrents at the point where they parted, to define the respective boundsof the divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principalsewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and thewidth, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in orderto determine the arrangements with regard to the level of eachwater-entrance, either of the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of thestreet. They advanced with toil. The lanterns pined away in the foulatmosphere. From time to time, a fainting sewerman was carried out.At certain points, there were precipices. The soil had given away, thepavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a bottomless well;they found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; they had greatdifficulty in getting him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, theylighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin, from time to time,in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, thewall was covered with misshapen fungi,--one would have said tumors; thevery stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere.Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point ofseparation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he decipheredupon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated thelimits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting thesubterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark ofthe sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork ofthe seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old RueVielle-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork ofthe eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walledand vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, thatof 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the beltsewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water ofMenilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, anadvancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valetde chambre to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.Here and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought theyrecognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the very seweritself. Hideous place! An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of thesecells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds were singular; amongothers, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from theJardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance probably connected withthe famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the Rue desBernardins, in the last year of the eighteenth century. The poor devilhad ended by drowning himself in the sewer.Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion,a perfectly preserved rag-picker's basket excited the admiration of allconnoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handlewith intrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold andsilver, precious stones, coins. If a giant had filtered this cesspool,he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair. At the pointwhere the two branches of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoyeseparate, they picked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing onone side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat, and on the other, a wolfwith a tiara on his head.The most surprising encounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer.This entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing butthe hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapelessrag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated therein the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart. Bruneseauheld his lantern close to this rag and examined it. It was of very finebatiste, and in one of the corners, less frayed than the rest, theymade out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters:LAVBESP. The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the seven letterssignified Laubespine. They recognized the fact, that what they hadbefore their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat in hisyouth had had amorous intrigues. This was when he was a member of thehousehold of the Comte d'Artois, in the capacity of physician to theStables. From these love affairs, historically proved, with a greatlady, he had retained this sheet. As a waif or a souvenir. At his death,as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house,they buried him in it. Some old women had shrouded him for the tomb inthat swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend of the people had enjoyedvoluptuousness. Bruneseau passed on. They left that rag where it hung;they did not put the finishing touch to it. Did this arise from scornor from respect? Marat deserved both. And then, destiny was theresufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it. Besides, thethings of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select. Inshort, the relic was a strange one. A Marquise had slept in it; Marathad rotted in it; it had traversed the Pantheon to end with the ratsof the sewer. This chamber rag, of which Watteau would formerly havejoyfully sketched every fold, had ended in becoming worthy of the fixedgaze of Dante.The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lastedseven years, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew,directed, and completed considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the archof the Ponceau, and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed thesewer, in 1809, under the Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain ofthe Innocents; in 1810, under the Rue Froidmanteau and under theSalpetriere; in 1811 under the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Peres, under the Ruedu Mail, under the Rue de l'Echarpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812,under the Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussee d'Antin. At the sametime, he had the whole net-work disinfected and rendered healthful. Inthe second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of hisson-in-law Nargaud.It was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient societycleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of its sewer. Therewas that much clean, at all events.Tortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies,jolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending illogically, fetid,wild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices on its pavementsand scars on its walls, terrible,--such was, retrospectively viewed, theantique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in every direction, crossings,of trenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, coecum,blind alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabbysweats, on the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness;nothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestiveapparatus of Babylon, a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, atitanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous blindmole, the past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth which hasbeen splendor.This, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.CHAPTER V--PRESENT PROGRESSTo-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizesthe ideal of what is understood in England by the word "respectable." Itis proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost sayas though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who hasbecome a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. Themire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might readilymistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were so commonin former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, inthose good old times, "when the people loved their kings." The presentsewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classicalrectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to havetaken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones ofthat long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue deRivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer. However, if the geometricalline is in place anywhere, it is certainly in the drainage trench ofa great city. There, everything should be subordinated to the shortestroad. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a certain official aspect. Thevery police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, no longerare wanting in respect towards it. The words which characterize it inadministrative language are sonorous and dignified. What used to becalled a gut is now called a gallery; what used to be called a hole isnow called a surveying orifice. Villon would no longer meet with hisancient temporary provisional lodging. This net-work of cellars has itsimmemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbersthan ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head atthe window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermingrow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace. Thecesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity. The rain,which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, donot trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. It ismore hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police andthe commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of all theprocesses of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor likeTartuffe after confession.Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homagewhich the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,Tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it iscertain that the sewers of Paris have been improved.It is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancientand the present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected thisrevolution?The man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned,Bruneseau.CHAPTER VI--FUTURE PROGRESSThe excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The lastten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to atermination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. Thesewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris.Within the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with athousand antennae, which expands below as the city expands above. Everytime that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. Theold monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundredmetres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in this respect on thefirst of January, 1806. Beginning with this epoch, of which we shallshortly speak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed andprosecuted; Napoleon built--the figures are curious--four thousand eighthundred and four metres; Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundredand nine; Charles X., ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-six;Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty; the Republic of1848, twenty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the presentgovernment, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time,two hundred and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres;sixty leagues of sewers; the enormous entrails of Paris. An obscureramification ever at work; a construction which is immense and ignored.As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-daymore than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It isdifficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts whichhave been required to bring this cess-pool to the point of relativeperfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty that theancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years ofthe eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded inperforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806.All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to thesoil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious populationof Paris. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious tothe pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothingmore difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formationupon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation calledParis; as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventuresupon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound. Thereare liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmireswhich special science calls moutardes.[59] The pick advances laboriouslythrough the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads ofclay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, thecontemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenlybursts through a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers;or a layer of marl is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of acataract, breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass. Quiterecently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass the collectingsewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation oremptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, watersuddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, which was beyondthe power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send a diver toexplore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of thegrand basin, and it was not without great difficulty that it was stoppedup. Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distancefrom the river, as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and LumierePassage, quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast, and inwhich a man sinks visibly. Add suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides,and sudden crumbling of the earth. Add the typhus, with which theworkmen become slowly impregnated. In our own day, after havingexcavated the gallery of Clichy, with a banquette to receive theprincipal water-conduit of Ourcq, a piece of work which was executed ina trench ten metres deep; after having, in the midst of land-slides, andwith the aid of excavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaultedthe Bievre from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as the Seine; afterhaving, in order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre and inorder to provide an outlet for that river-like pool nine hectares inextent, which crouched near the Barriere des Martyrs, after having, letus state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere Blanche tothe road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and night, at adepth of eleven metres; after having--a thing heretofore unseen--made asubterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, sixmetres below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. After havingvaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city, fromthe Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l'Ourcine, after havingfreed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of rain by meansof the branch of the Arbalete, after having built the Saint-Georgessewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having directedthe formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in theNotre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the engineer died. There are nobulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which are more useful,nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle.The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.Bruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required tobring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It issurprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer,called the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncoveredto the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the cityof Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eightyfrancs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth. Thethree absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mande, withtheir discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and theirdepuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Parishas been made over anew, and, as we have said, it has been extended morethan tenfold within the last quarter of a century.Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th ofJune, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer.A very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunkencauseways. At the end of a slope, where the tributaries of a street orcross-roads ended, there were often to be seen large, square gratingswith heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps of the throng,gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles, and caused horses to fall.The official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these gratingsthe expressive name of Cassis.[60]In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l'Etoile, the RueSaint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vielle-duTemple, the RueNotre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Mericourt, the Quai aux Fleurs,the Rue du Petit-Muse, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches,the Rue des Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Damedes-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Bateliere, in theChamps-Elysees, the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ancient gothicsewer still cynically displayed its maw. It consisted of enormousvoids of stone catch-basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts, withmonumental effrontery.Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1stof January, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between1806 and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred andfifty metres annually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres ofgalleries were constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, withhydraulic mortar which hardens under water, on a cement foundation. Attwo hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris' sewers of thepresent day represent forty-eight millions.In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at thebeginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with thatimmense question: the sewers of Paris.Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.The sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, butalready sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green claysituated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer maybe represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference; amultitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, theMarne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and theLoire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of wateris healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from theearth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All themiasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath of the city; hencethis bad breath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has beenscientifically proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. Ina given time, with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, andas light increases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify thesheet of air; that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, thatby "washing the sewer" we mean: the restitution of the filth to theearth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields.Through this simple act, the entire social community will experience adiminution of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour,the radiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues around theLouvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.We might say that, for ten centuries, the cess-pool has been the diseaseof Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. Thepopular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation ofsewermen was formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to thepeople, as the occupation of knacker, which was so long held in horrorand handed over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to inducea mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-poolcleaner hesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form:"to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;" and all sorts ofhideous legends, as we have said, covered this colossal sink withterror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the revolutionsof the globe as of the revolutions of man, and where are to be foundvestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to the rag ofMarat.BOOK THIRD.--MUD BUT THE SOULCHAPTER I--THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISESIt was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean,the diver may disappear there.The transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city,Jean Valjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye,in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passedfrom broad daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, fromtumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation ofthe tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that ofthe Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the most absoluteobscurity.An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-doorof Paris; to quit that street where death was on every side, for thatsort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. Heremained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening, stupefied.The waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him. Celestialgoodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery. Adorableambuscades of providence!Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not knowwhether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or adead corpse.His first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, he could seenothing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become deaf.He no longer heard anything. The frantic storm of murder which had beenlet loose a few feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to thethickness of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said,otherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in thedepths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all;but that was enough. He extended one arm and then the other, touchedthe walls on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; heslipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously putforward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered thatthe paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the place inwhich he stood.After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little lightfell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyesbecame accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something. Thepassage in which he had burrowed--no other word can better express thesituation--was walled in behind him. It was one of those blind alleys,which the special jargon terms branches. In front of him there wasanother wall, a wall like night. The light of the air-hole died out tenor twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely casta wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond,the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, anentrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man could, however,plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste waseven requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which hehad caught sight of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye ofthe soldiery, and that everything hung upon this chance. They also mightdescend into that well and search it. There was not a minute to be lost.He had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him up again,--that isthe real word for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and setout. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. Perilsof another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, perchance. Afterthe lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern of miasmas andtraps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had fallen from one circleof hell into another.When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problempresented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which heencountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. Whichshould he take? Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was heto find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to whichwe have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, which is itsslope. To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; thatif he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he wouldarrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the Seinebetween the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he wouldmake his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spotin Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersectionof streets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding menemerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a call toarms of the neighboring post of guards. Thus they would be seized beforethey had even got out. It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth,to confide themselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providencefor the outcome.He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer of anair-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more,and he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly aspossible. Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former'sfeet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, andgroped along the wall with the other. Marius' cheek touched his, andclung there, bleeding. He felt a warm stream which came from Mariustrickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes. But ahumid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man touched,indicated respiration, and consequently, life. The passage along whichJean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. JeanValjean walked through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of thepreceding day had not, as yet, entirely run off, and it created a littletorrent in the centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wallin order not to have his feet in the water.Thus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the nightgroping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holesemitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether hiseyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision returnedto him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, now of the wallwhich he touched, now of the vault beneath which he was passing. Thepupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune and endsby finding God there.It was not easy to direct his course.The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streetswhich lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundredstreets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomybranches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing atthat epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of elevenleagues. We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to thespecial activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixtyleagues in extent.Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he wasbeneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Underthe Rue Saint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from LouisXIII. and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the GrandSewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation of theancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin sewer,whose four arms describe a cross. But the gut of the Petite-Truanderiethe entrance to which was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop hasnever communicated with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it endedat the Montmartre sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean wasentangled. There opportunities of losing oneself abound. The Montmartresewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network.Fortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of the marketswhose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude ofparrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but he had before him morethan one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner--forthey are streets--presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogationpoint; first, on his left, the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort ofChinese puzzle, thrusting out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zsunder the Post-Office and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as faras the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, thecurving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, whichare also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of theMail, complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, andproceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand crypt ofthe outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every direction; andlastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeuneurs, withoutcounting little ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer,which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to besafe.Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out, hewould speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, that he wasnot in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. Instead of theancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, haughty and royaleven in the sewer, with pavement and string courses of granite andmortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom, he would have felt underhis hand contemporary cheapness, economical expedients, porous stonefilled with mortar on a concrete foundation, which costs two hundredfrancs the metre, and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petitsmateriaux--small stuff; but of all this he knew nothing.He advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, knowingnothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in providence.By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloomwhich enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. Thisaqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion.It is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. JeanValjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeingit. In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. Howwas he to get out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time?would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allowitself to be penetrated and pierced? should he there encounter someunexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the inextricableand the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he ofhunger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing twoskeletons in a nook of that night? He did not know. He put all thesequestions to himself without replying to them. The intestines of Parisform a precipice. Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.All at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, andwithout having ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived that hewas no longer ascending; the water of the rivulet was beating againsthis heels, instead of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was nowdescending. Why? Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine? Thisdanger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was still greater.He continued to advance.It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge whichthe soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water-shedsinto the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of thisridge which determines the division of the waters describes a verycapricious line. The culminating point, which is the point ofseparation of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the RueMichelle-Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, andin the Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating pointthat Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing his course towards thebelt sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know it.Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, and ifhe found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than thepassage in which he was, he did not enter but continued his route,rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blindalley, and could only lead him further from his goal, that is to say,the outlet. Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him inthe darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneaththe Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades hadsuppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living andnormal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distantbut continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to thecalculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not yet thought ofrest; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius.The darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth reassuredhim.All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined ona faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled theflooring vault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to hisright and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied,he turned round.Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passedthrough, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the denseobscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveyinghim.It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer.In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in aconfused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.CHAPTER II--EXPLANATIONOn the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had beenordered. It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them forrefuge, and Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while GeneralBugeaud swept public Paris; a double and connected operation whichexacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, representedabove by the army and below by the police. Three squads of agents andsewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris, the first on theright bank, the second on the left bank, the third in the city. Theagents of police were armed with carabines, with bludgeons, swords andpoignards.That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lanternof the patrol of the right bank.This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blindalleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passingtheir lantern through the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean hadencountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, had perceivedthat it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetratedthither. He had passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallerydu Cadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in thedirection of the belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of JeanValjean. The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern,and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whencethe sound proceeded.This was an indescribable moment for Jean Valjean.Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. Itwas light and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with thedarkness of the place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he didnot understand what it was that was moving behind him. The lack of sleepand food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state ofa visionary. He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms. What wasit? He did not comprehend.Jean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.The men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and sawnothing. They held a consultation.There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a sortof cross-roads called de service, which was afterwards suppressed, onaccount of the little interior lake which formed there, swallowing upthe torrent of rain in heavy storms. The patrol could form a cluster inthis open space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle.These bull-dogs' heads approached each other closely and whisperedtogether.The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they hadbeen mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to getentangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time,but that they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if therewas anything to do, and any "bousingot" to track out, it was in thatquarter.From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the wordbousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had becomeobsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellentservice.The sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed ofthe Seine.If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go inboth directions, Jean Valjean would have been captured. All hung onthat thread. It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture,foreseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force, hadforbidden the patrol to part company. The patrol resumed its march,leaving Jean Valjean behind it. Of all this movement, Jean Valjeanperceived nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenlywheeled round.Before taking his departure, the Sergeant, in order to acquit hispoliceman's conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of JeanValjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like therumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into thestream and splashed up the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean,warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head.Slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work,gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the groupof black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated,communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, thendisappeared; the silence became profound once more, the obscurity becamecomplete, blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows;and Jean Valjean, not daring to stir as yet, remained for a long timeleaning with his back against the wall, with straining ears, and dilatedpupils, watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.CHAPTER III--THE "SPUN" MANThis justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even inthe most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its dutiesconnected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its eyes,no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths,and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was inperil. The ordinary service was performed correctly in company with theextraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In the midstof an incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure ofa possible revolution, a police agent, "spun" a thief without allowinghimself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades.It was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoonof the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the slope of the rightshore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.There is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality haschanged.On that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed to bewatching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who wasin advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying toovertake the other.It was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence.Neither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as thougheach of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble hispace.One would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, andpurposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty andon its guard.The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dogwere observed. The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificantmien and not an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seizehim was rude of aspect, and must have been rude to encounter.The first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second;but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; any one whocould have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombrehostility of flight, and all the menace that fear contains.The shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even a boatman nora lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there.It was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, andto any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who wasin advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and equivocalbeing, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and theother like a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat ofauthority buttoned to the chin.Perchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were to seethem closer at hand.What was the object of the second man?Probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.When a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in orderto make of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the wholequestion lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; to bedressed in red is disagreeable.There is a purple from below.It is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort whichthe first man is desirous of shirking.If the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him as yet, itwas, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up tosome significant meeting-place and to some group worth catching. Thisdelicate operation is called "spinning."What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-upman, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quayas it was passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; the driverunderstood, evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal,turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay,at a foot-pace. This was not observed by the slouching and tatteredpersonage who was in advance.The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Elysees. Thebust of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along above theparapet.One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agentscontains this article: "Always have on hand a hackney-coach, in case ofemergency."While these two men were manoeuvring, each on his own side, withirreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on the quaywhich descended to the shore, and which permitted cab-drivers arrivingfrom Passy to come to the river and water their horses. This inclinedplane was suppressed later on, for the sake of symmetry; horses may dieof thirst, but the eye is gratified.It is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascendthis inclined plane, with a view to making his escape into theChamps-Elysees, a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, muchinfested with policemen, and where the other could easily exerciseviolence.This point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought toParis from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as "the houseof Francois I." A guard house is situated close at hand.To the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked didnot mount by the inclined plane for watering. He continued to advancealong the quay on the shore.His position was visibly becoming critical.What was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into the Seine?Henceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; there wasno other inclined plane, no staircase; and they were near the spot,marked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jena, where thebank, growing constantly narrower, ended in a slender tongue, andwas lost in the water. There he would inevitably find himself blockedbetween the perpendicular wall on his right, the river on his left andin front of him, and the authorities on his heels.It is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by aheap of rubbish six or seven feet in height, produced by some demolitionor other. But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behindthat heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt? The expedient wouldhave been puerile. He certainly was not dreaming of such a thing. Theinnocence of thieves does not extend to that point.The pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge,which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay.The man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and wentround it, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.The latter, as he did not see, could not be seen; he took advantage ofthis fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly. In afew moments, he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it. Therehe halted in sheer amazement. The man whom he had been pursuing was nolonger there.Total eclipse of the man in the blouse.The shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty paceslong, then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of thequay. The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine withoutbeing seen by the man who was following him. What had become of him?The man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore,and remained there in thought for a moment, his fists clenched, his eyessearching. All at once he smote his brow. He had just perceived, at thepoint where the land came to an end and the water began, a large irongrating, low, arched, garnished with a heavy lock and with three massivehinges. This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay,opened on the river as well as on the shore. A blackish stream passedunder it. This stream discharged into the Seine.Beyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted corridorcould be descried. The man folded his arms and stared at the gratingwith an air of reproach.As this gaze did not suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; he shookit, it resisted solidly. It is probable that it had just been opened,although no sound had been heard, a singular circumstance in so rusty agrating; but it is certain that it had been closed again. This indicatedthat the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but akey.This evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying tomove the grating, and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation:"That is too much! A government key!"Then, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a whole worldof interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almostironically: "Come! Come! Come! Come!"That said, and in the hope of something or other, either that he shouldsee the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself on the watchbehind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer.The hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, in itsturn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The coachman,foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' muzzles in the bag ofoats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar to Parisians,to whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government sometimes applies it.The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jena turned their heads, before theypursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these two motionlessitems in the landscape, the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay.CHAPTER IV--HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSSJean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaultsvaries; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has beencalculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bendover, in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every stephe had to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. Themoisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber frameworkfurnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot.He stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittentgleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, and wereso wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; allthe rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean was bothhungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was aplace full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which wasprodigious, as the reader knows, and which had been but little decreasedby age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, began to give way,nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his strengthdecreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius, who was,perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean Valjeanheld him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and so thatrespiration could proceed as well as possible. Between his legs he feltthe rapid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to such adegree that he bit him. From time to time, a breath of fresh air reachedhim through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and re-animatedhim.It might have been three hours past midday when he reached thebelt-sewer.He was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself,all at once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reachthe two walls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. TheGrand Sewer is, in fact, eight feet wide and seven feet high.At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two othersubterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of theAbattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious manwould have remained undecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest, thatis to say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again came up--shouldhe descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required haste, andthat he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he mustdescend. He turned to the left.It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that thebelt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the othertowards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterraneangirdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, itmust be remembered, nothing else than the old brook of Menilmontant,terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at itsancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of theknoll of Menilmontant. There is no direct communication with thebranch which collects the waters of Paris beginning with the QuartierPopincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewerabove the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes thecollecting sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Menilmontantitself, by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters, betweenupstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery hewould have arrived, after a thousand efforts, and broken down withfatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He wouldhave been lost.In case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, and enteringthe passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did nothesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and bytaking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left,then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, hemight have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided that he didnot go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, he mighthave attained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. But in orderto do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormousmadrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings.Now, we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drainwhich he was traversing; and had any one asked him in what he was, hewould have answered: "In the night."His instinct served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible safety.He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in theform of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and thelong, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussee d'Antin.A little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch,he halted. He was extremely weary. A passably large air-hole, probablythe man-hole in the Rue d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almostvivid. Jean Valjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brotherwould exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on thebanquette of the sewer. Marius' blood-stained face appeared under thewan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. Hiseyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like apainter's brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp and dead. Aclot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his limbs werecold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt hadthrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing theyawning gashes in the living flesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside thegarments with the tips of his fingers, laid his hand upon Marius'breast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean tore up his shirt,bandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped theflowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconsciousand almost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him withinexpressible hatred.On disarranging Marius' garments, he had found two things in hispockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the precedingevening, and Marius' pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened thepocketbook. On the first page he found the four lines written by Marius.The reader will recall them:"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais."Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, andremained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating in a lowtone: "Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand." Hereplaced the pocketbook in Marius' pocket. He had eaten, his strengthhad returned to him; he took Marius up once more upon his back, placedthe latter's head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed hisdescent of the sewer.The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley ofMenilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout anotable portion of its extent.This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we areilluminating for the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean march, JeanValjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the cityhe was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor ofthe pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated tohim that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the daywould soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having becomeintermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, heconcluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that hewas approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outerboulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses andstreets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around JeanValjean. Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in thedark.Suddenly this darkness became terrible.CHAPTER V--IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE IS A FINENESSWHICH IS TREACHEROUSHe felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had apavement under his feet, but only mud.It sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland aman, either a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on thebeach far from shore, suddenly notices that for several minutes past,he has been walking with some difficulty. The beach under foot islike pitch; his soles stick fast to it; it is no longer sand, it isbird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, but at every step that he takes,as soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled with water. Theeye, however, has perceived no change; the immense beach is smooth andtranquil, all the sand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes thesoil that is solid from that which is not solid; the joyous littlecloud of sand-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of thepasser-by.The man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavorsto approach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he isconscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at everystep that he takes. All at once he sinks in. He sinks in two or threeinches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts to get hisbearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; his feet have disappeared.The sand has covered them. He draws his feet out of the sand, he triesto retrace his steps, he turns back, he sinks in more deeply thanbefore. The sand is up to his ankles, he tears himself free from itand flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flingshimself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, withindescribable terror, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in aquicksand, and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in whichneither man can walk nor fish can swim. He flings away his burden, if hehave one, he lightens himself, like a ship in distress; it is too late,the sand is above his knees.He shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continuallygains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, ifthe bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood,all is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. He is condemned to thatterrible interment, long, infallible, implacable, which it is impossibleto either retard or hasten, which lasts for hours, which will not cometo an end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, whichdrags you down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, atevery shout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the airof punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp, which forcesa man to return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey thehorizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages onthe plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which flyand sing, the sun and the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre whichassumes a tide, and which mounts from the depths of the earth towardsa living man. Each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead. Thewretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb; every movementthat he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks; hefeels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to theclouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate. Behold him in the sand upto his belly, the sand reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now.He uplifts his hands, utters furious groans, clenches his nails on thebeach, tries to cling fast to that ashes, supports himself on his elbowsin order to raise himself from that soft sheath, and sobs frantically;the sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sandreaches to his throat; only his face is visible now. His mouth criesaloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still gaze forth, the sandcloses them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little hair quivers abovethe sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves anddisappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.Sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter isswallowed up with his cart; all founders in that strand. It is shipwreckelsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man. The earth,permeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents itself in theguise of a plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is subject tothese treacheries.This melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was alsopossible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drainof Paris was subject to these sudden slides.The water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which wereparticularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as inthe ancient sewers, or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries,having no longer an underpinning, gave way. A fold in a flooring of thissort means a crack, means crumbling. The framework crumbled away for acertain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called afontis, in the special tongue. What is a fontis? It is the quicksands ofthe seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth; it isthe beach of Mont Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil is in astate of fusion, as it were; all its molecules are in suspension in softmedium; it is not earth and it is not water. The depth is sometimes verygreat. Nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter. If thewater predominates, death is prompt, the man is swallowed up; if earthpredominates, death is slow.Can any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by theearth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cess-pool? Instead ofthe open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds,those free clouds whence rains life, instead of those barks descriedin the distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probablepassers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,--insteadof all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tombalready prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow suffocationby filth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire andclutches you by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle;slime instead of the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of thehurricane, dung in place of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one'steeth, and to writhe, and to struggle, and to agonize, with thatenormous city which knows nothing of it all, over one's head!Inexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeemshis atrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, inshipwreck, one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superbattitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes.But not here. Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. The supremefloating visions are abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. It ispetty, ugly, infamous. To die in a butt of Malvoisie, like Clarence, ispermissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, like Escoubleau, is horrible.To struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that one is goingthrough the death agony, one is floundering about. There are shadowsenough for hell, and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough, andthe dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectreor a frog.Everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed.The depth of the fontis varied, as well as their length and theirdensity, according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil.Sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or ten;sometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost solid,there almost liquid. In the Luniere fontis, it would have taken a man aday to disappear, while he would have been devoured in five minutes bythe Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up more or less, according to itsdensity. A child can escape where a man will perish. The first law ofsafety is to get rid of every sort of load. Every sewerman who felt theground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools,or his back-basket, or his hod.The fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil;some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summerrains; the incessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers.Sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soilforced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them tobend aside, or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split underthis crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthenon,obliterated, a century ago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Genevievehill. When a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses, themischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space,like the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice wasdeveloped in an undulating line throughout the entire length of thecracked vault, and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could bepromptly applied. It also frequently happened, that the interior ravageswere not revealed by any external scar, and in that case, woe to thesewermen. When they entered without precaution into the sewer, they wereliable to be lost. Ancient registers make mention of several scavengerswho were buried in fontis in this manner. They give many names; amongothers, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire underthe man-hole of the Rue Careme-Prenant, a certain Blaise Poutrain; thisBlaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain, who was the lastgrave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des Innocents, in 1785,the epoch when that cemetery expired.There was also that young and charming Vicomte d'Escoubleau, of whom wehave just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida, where theydelivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head.D'Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin's, the Duchess deSourdis', was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, in whichhe had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de Sourdis,when informed of his death, demanded her smelling-bottle, and forgot toweep, through sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is no lovewhich holds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash thebody of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of Pyramus andsays: "Phew!"CHAPTER VI--THE FONTISJean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of theChamps-Elysees, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a badpreservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of itsexcessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of thesands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered bya stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata,infected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquidthat the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery desMartyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stonesewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honore, in which we now see JeanValjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, thequicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Elysees as far as theSeine, presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearlysix months, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside,particularly those who had hotels and carriages. The work was more thanunhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and ahalf of rain, and three floods of the Seine.The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the downpourof the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacentsand, had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water.Infiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated bottomhad sunk into the ooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The obscuritywas more dense there than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern ofnight.Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He enteredthis slime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He mustpass it. To retrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and JeanValjean exhausted. Besides, where was he to go? Jean Valjean advanced.Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to be very deep.But in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper. Soon he hadthe slime up to his calves and water above his knees. He walked on,raising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. The mirenow reached to his knees, and the water to his waist. He could no longerretreat. This mud, dense enough for one man, could not, obviously,uphold two. Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance ofextricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance,supporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.The water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; it wasonly with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze whichhe had now reached. The density, which was his support, was alsoan obstacle. He still held Marius on high, and with an unheard-ofexpenditure of force, he advanced still; but he was sinking. He had onlyhis head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius. In theold paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus.He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape thewater, and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who hadseen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was amask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint glimpse above him of thedrooping head and livid face of Marius; he made a desperate effort andlaunched his foot forward; his foot struck something solid; a point ofsupport. It was high time.He straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point ofsupport with a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of thefirst step in a staircase leading back to life.The point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the suprememoment, was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement, whichhad bent but had not given way, and which had curved under the waterlike a plank and in a single piece. Well built pavements form a vaultand possess this sort of firmness. This fragment of the vaulting, partlysubmerged, but solid, was a veritable inclined plane, and, once on thisplane, he was safe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reachedthe other side of the quagmire.As he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fellupon his knees. He reflected that this was but just, and he remainedthere for some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.He rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed beneaththe dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping with slime,and his soul filled with a strange light.CHAPTER VII--ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE ISDISEMBARKINGHe set out on his way once more.However, although he had not left his life in the fontis, he seemedto have left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort hadexhausted him. His lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pausefor breath every three or four steps, and lean against the wall. Oncehe was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter Marius'position, and he thought that he should have to remain there. But if hisvigor was dead, his energy was not. He rose again.He walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus for a hundredpaces, almost without drawing breath, and suddenly came in contact withthe wall. He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at theturn with head bent down, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes,and at the extremity of the vault, far, very far away in front of him,he perceived a light. This time it was not that terrible light; it wasgood, white light. It was daylight. Jean Valjean saw the outlet.A damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenlyperceive the outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt.It would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards thatradiant portal. Jean Valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue, he nolonger felt Marius' weight, he found his legs once more of steel, he ranrather than walked. As he approached, the outlet became more and moredistinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault, whichgradually narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed in asthe vault grew lower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel;a faulty construction, imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries,logical in a prison, illogical in a sewer, and which has since beencorrected.Jean Valjean reached the outlet.There he halted.It certainly was the outlet, but he could not get out.The arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to allappearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped to its stonejamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like an enormousbrick. The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk inthe iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of thoseprison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.Beyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the shore,very narrow but sufficient for escape. The distant quays, Paris, thatgulf in which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty.On the right, down stream, the bridge of Jena was discernible, on theleft, upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would have been apropitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was oneof the most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces theGrand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of thegrating.It might have been half-past eight o'clock in the evening. The day wasdeclining.Jean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion of thevaulting, then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round thebars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, but it did not move. Thegrating did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other,in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid, and tomake of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock. Nota bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in theirsockets. No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was invincible.There was no means of opening the gate.Must he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him?He had not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journeywhich he had already taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse thatquagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle? Andafter the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredlycould not be twice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? Whatdirection should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conducthim to his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would find itobstructed by a plug or a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closedin that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through which he hadentered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred.He had only succeeded in escaping into a prison.All was over. Everything that Jean Valjean had done was useless.Exhaustion had ended in failure.They were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and JeanValjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands andquivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, and fellupon the pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, close to Marius,who still made no movement, and with his head bent between his knees.This was the last drop of anguish.Of what was he thinking during this profound depression? Neither ofhimself nor of Marius. He was thinking of Cosette.CHAPTER VIII--THE TORN COAT-TAILIn the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and alow voice said to him:"Half shares."Some person in that gloom? Nothing so closely resembles a dream asdespair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. He had heard nofootsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes.A man stood before him.This man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoesin his left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach JeanValjean, without allowing his steps to be heard.Jean Valjean did not hesitate for an instant. Unexpected as was thisencounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thenardier.Although awakened, so to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, accustomedto alarms, and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptlyparried, instantly regained possession of his presence of mind.Moreover, the situation could not be made worse, a certain degree ofdistress is no longer capable of a crescendo, and Thenardier himselfcould add nothing to this blackness of this night.A momentary pause ensued.Thenardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, formedwith it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing uphis eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of themouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoringto recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean, as we havejust stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was, moreover,so disfigured, so bemired, so bleeding that he would have beenunrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by thelight from the grating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet precisein its lividness, Thenardier, as the energetic popular metaphorexpresses it, immediately "leaped into" Jean Valjean's eyes. Thisinequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to JeanValjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginningbetween the two situations and the two men. The encounter took placebetween Jean Valjean veiled and Thenardier unmasked.Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thenardier did not recognizehim.They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as thoughtaking each other's measure. Thenardier was the first to break thesilence."How are you going to manage to get out?"Jean Valjean made no reply. Thenardier continued:"It's impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must getout of this.""That is true," said Jean Valjean."Well, half shares then.""What do you mean by that?""You have killed that man; that's all right. I have the key."Thenardier pointed to Marius. He went on:"I don't know you, but I want to help you. You must be a friend."Jean Valjean began to comprehend. Thenardier took him for an assassin.Thenardier resumed:"Listen, comrade. You didn't kill that man without looking to see whathe had in his pockets. Give me my half. I'll open the door for you."And half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, he added:"Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here."Jean Valjean "remained stupid"--the expression belongs to the elderCorneille--to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld wasreal. It was providence appearing in horrible guise, and his good angelspringing from the earth in the form of Thenardier.Thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under hisblouse, drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean."Hold on," said he, "I'll give you the rope to boot.""What is the rope for?""You will need a stone also, but you can find one outside. There's aheap of rubbish.""What am I to do with a stone?""Idiot, you'll want to sling that stiff into the river, you'll need astone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water."Jean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionallyaccept in this mechanical way.Thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurredto him."Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that sloughyonder? I haven't dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you don't smellgood."After a pause he added:"I'm asking you questions, but you're perfectly right not to answer.It's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before theexamining magistrate. And then, when you don't talk at all, you run norisk of talking too loud. That's no matter, as I can't see your face andas I don't know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don't knowwho you are and what you want. I twig. You've broken up that gentlemana bit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river, that greathider of folly, is what you want. I'll get you out of your scrape.Helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair."While expressing his approval of Jean Valjean's silence, he endeavoredto force him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch asight of his profile, and he exclaimed, without, however, raising histone:"Apropos of that quagmire, you're a hearty animal. Why didn't you tossthe man in there?"Jean Valjean preserved silence.Thenardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to thelevel of his Adam's apple, a gesture which completes the capable air ofa serious man:"After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow tostop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there,and it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, topick up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer.Who? Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The police are fullof cleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you. Such afind is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use ofthe sewers for their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. Theriver is the true grave. At the end of a month they fish up your manin the nets at Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It'scarrion! Who killed that man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. Youhave done well."The more loquacious Thenardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean.Again Thenardier shook him by the shoulder."Now let's settle this business. Let's go shares. You have seen my key,show me your money."Thenardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yetamicable.There was one singular circumstance; Thenardier's manners were notsimple; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affectingan air of mystery, he spoke low; from time to time he laid his finger onhis mouth, and muttered, "hush!" It was difficult to divine why. Therewas no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that otherruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook, not very far off, andthat Thenardier did not care to share with them.Thenardier resumed:"Let's settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?"Jean Valjean searched his pockets.It was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have somemoney about him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had beencondemned imposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, however,he had been caught unprepared. When donning his uniform of a NationalGuardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully absorbedas he was, to take his pocket-book. He had only some small change in hisfob. He turned out his pocket, all soaked with ooze, and spread out onthe banquette of the vault one louis d'or, two five-franc pieces, andfive or six large sous.Thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of theneck."You knocked him over cheap," said he.He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with thegreatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly concerned in keepinghis back to the light, let him have his way.While handling Marius' coat, Thenardier, with the skill of a pickpocket,and without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip which heconcealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel ofstuff might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and theassassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs."That's true," said he, "both of you together have no more than that."And, forgetting his motto: "half shares," he took all.He hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he tookthem also, muttering:"Never mind! You cut folks' throats too cheap altogether."That done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse."Now, my friend, you must leave. It's like the fair here, you pay whenyou go out. You have paid, now clear out."And he began to laugh.Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in makingsome other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure anddisinterested intention of rescuing an assassin? We may be permitted todoubt this.Thenardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, thenhe betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making JeanValjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger on his mouth,and remained for several seconds, as though in suspense; his inspectionfinished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and thegate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly.It was obvious that this gate and those hinges, carefully oiled, werein the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. Thissoftness was suspicious; it hinted at furtive goings and comings, silententrances and exits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of crime.The sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. Thistaciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.Thenardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient spacefor Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the keya double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, withoutmaking any more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvetpaws of a tiger.A moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into theinvisibility.Jean Valjean found himself in the open air.CHAPTER IX--MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER,THE EFFECT OF BEING DEADHe allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore.They were in the open air!The miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful,living, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywherearound him reigned silence, but that charming silence when the sun hasset in an unclouded azure sky. Twilight had descended; night was drawingon, the great deliverer, the friend of all those who need a mantle ofdarkness that they may escape from an anguish. The sky presented itselfin all directions like an enormous calm. The river flowed to his feetwith the sound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding eachother good night in the elms of the Champs-Elysees was audible. A fewstars, daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith, and visible torevery alone, formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity.Evening was unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness ofthe infinite.It was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no.Night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to loseoneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight topermit of recognition at close quarters.For several seconds, Jean Valjean was irresistibly overcome by thataugust and caressing serenity; such moments of oblivion do come to men;suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; everything iseclipsed in the thoughts; peace broods over the dreamer like night; and,beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which isilluminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean couldnot refrain from contemplating that vast, clear shadow which restedover him; thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in themajestic silence of the eternal heavens. Then he bent down swiftlyto Marius, as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him, and,dipping up water in the hollow of his hand, he gently sprinkled afew drops on the latter's face. Marius' eyelids did not open; but hishalf-open mouth still breathed.Jean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river oncemore, when, all at once, he experienced an indescribable embarrassment,such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he doesnot see.We have already alluded to this impression, with which everyone isfamiliar.He turned round.Some one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short whilebefore.A man of lofty stature, enveloped in a long coat, with folded arms,and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head wasvisible, stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjeanwas crouching over Marius.With the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. Anordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight, athoughtful man on account of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean recognizedJavert.The reader has divined, no doubt, that Thenardier's pursuer was no otherthan Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade,had betaken himself to the prefecture of police, had rendered averbal account to the Prefect in person in a brief audience, had thenimmediately gone on duty again, which implied--the note, the reader willrecollect, which had been captured on his person--a certain surveillanceof the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Elysees,which had, for some time past, aroused the attention of the police.There he had caught sight of Thenardier and had followed him. The readerknows the rest.Thus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obliginglyopened to Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thenardier's part.Thenardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spiedupon has a scent which never deceives him; it was necessary to flinga bone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend! Such anopportunity must never be allowed to slip. Thenardier, by putting JeanValjean outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forcedthem to relinquish his scent, made them forget him in a biggeradventure, repaid Javert for his waiting, which always flatters a spy,earned thirty francs, and counted with certainty, so far as he himselfwas concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.Jean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another.These two encounters, this falling one after the other, from Thenardierupon Javert, was a rude shock.Javert did not recognize Jean Valjean, who, as we have stated, no longerlooked like himself. He did not unfold his arms, he made sure of hisbludgeon in his fist, by an imperceptible movement, and said in a curt,calm voice:"Who are you?""I.""Who is 'I'?""Jean Valjean."Javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth, bent his knees, inclinedhis body, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean,which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices, scrutinizedhim, and recognized him. Their faces almost touched. Javert's look wasterrible.Jean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert's grasp, like a lionsubmitting to the claws of a lynx."Inspector Javert," said he, "you have me in your power. Moreover, Ihave regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning. I did notgive you my address with any intention of escaping from you. Take me.Only grant me one favor."Javert did not appear to hear him. He kept his eyes riveted on JeanValjean. His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards towardshis nose, a sign of savage revery. At length he released Jean Valjean,straightened himself stiffly up without bending, grasped his bludgeonagain firmly, and, as though in a dream, he murmured rather than utteredthis question:"What are you doing here? And who is this man?"He still abstained from addressing Jean Valjean as thou.Jean Valjean replied, and the sound of his voice appeared to rouseJavert:"It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you. Dispose of meas you see fit; but first help me to carry him home. That is all that Iask of you."Javert's face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed tothink him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did not say"no."Again he bent over, drew from his pocket a handkerchief whichhe moistened in the water and with which he then wiped Marius'blood-stained brow."This man was at the barricade," said he in a low voice and as thoughspeaking to himself. "He is the one they called Marius."A spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, listened toeverything, and taken in everything, even when he thought that he was todie; who had played the spy even in his agony, and who, with his elbowsleaning on the first step of the sepulchre, had taken notes.He seized Marius' hand and felt his pulse."He is wounded," said Jean Valjean."He is a dead man," said Javert.Jean Valjean replied:"No. Not yet.""So you have brought him thither from the barricade?" remarked Javert.His preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not toinsist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, and for him not toeven notice Jean Valjean's silence after his question.Jean Valjean, on his side, seemed to have but one thought. He resumed:"He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with hisgrandfather. I do not recollect his name."Jean Valjean fumbled in Marius' coat, pulled out his pocket-book, openedit at the page which Marius had pencilled, and held it out to Javert.There was still sufficient light to admit of reading. Besides this,Javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of nightbirds. He deciphered the few lines written by Marius, and muttered:"Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du Calvaire, No. 6."Then he exclaimed: "Coachman!"The reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case ofneed.Javert kept Marius' pocket-book.A moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined planeof the watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid upon the backseat, and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean.The door slammed, and the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending thequays in the direction of the Bastille.They quitted the quays and entered the streets. The coachman, a blackform on his box, whipped up his thin horses. A glacial silence reignedin the carriage. Marius, motionless, with his body resting in thecorner, and his head drooping on his breast, his arms hanging, his legsstiff, seemed to be awaiting only a coffin; Jean Valjean seemed made ofshadow, and Javert of stone, and in that vehicle full of night, whoseinterior, every time that it passed in front of a street lantern,appeared to be turned lividly wan, as by an intermittent flash oflightning, chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to facethe three forms of tragic immobility, the corpse, the spectre, and thestatue.CHAPTER X--RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFEAt every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled from Marius'hair.Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire.Javert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance of thenumber on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker of beateniron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat and a satyrconfronting each other, he gave a violent peal. The gate opened a littleway and Javert gave it a push. The porter half made his appearanceyawning, vaguely awake, and with a candle in his hand.Everyone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in theMarais, especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, oldquarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, aschildren, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads hastilyunder their coverlet.In the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius out ofthe carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, and thecoachman under the knees.As they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under thelatter's clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, and assuredhimself that his heart was still beating. It was even beating a littleless feebly, as though the movement of the carriage had brought about acertain fresh access of life.Javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, and thepresence of the porter of a factious person."Some person whose name is Gillenormand?""Here. What do you want with him?""His son is brought back.""His son?" said the porter stupidly."He is dead."Jean Valjean, who, soiled and tattered, stood behind Javert, and whomthe porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign to him with hishead that this was not so.The porter did not appear to understand either Javert's words or JeanValjean's sign.Javert continued:"He went to the barricade, and here he is.""To the barricade?" ejaculated the porter."He has got himself killed. Go waken his father."The porter did not stir."Go along with you!" repeated Javert.And he added:"There will be a funeral here to-morrow."For Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were categoricallyclassed, which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance, and eachcontingency had its own compartment; all possible facts were arrangedin drawers, as it were, whence they emerged on occasion, in variablequantities; in the street, uproar, revolt, carnival, and funeral.The porter contented himself with waking Basque. Basque woke Nicolette;Nicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand.As for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he wouldhear about the matter early enough in any case.Marius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the otherparts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited on an old sofain M. Gillenormand's antechamber; and while Basque went in search of aphysician, and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses, Jean Valjeanfelt Javert touch him on the shoulder. He understood and descended thestairs, having behind him the step of Javert who was following him.The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched theirarrival, in terrified somnolence.They entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted his box."Inspector Javert," said Jean, "grant me yet another favor.""What is it?" demanded Javert roughly."Let me go home for one instant. Then you shall do whatever you likewith me."Javert remained silent for a few moments, with his chin drawn back intothe collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass and front:"Driver," said he, "Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7."CHAPTER XI--CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTEThey did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride.What did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warnCosette, to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some otheruseful information, to take, if he could, certain final measures. Asfor himself, so far as he was personally concerned, all was over; he hadbeen seized by Javert and had not resisted; any other man than himselfin like situation would, perhaps, have had some vague thoughts connectedwith the rope which Thenardier had given him, and of the bars of thefirst cell that he should enter; but, let us impress it upon thereader, after the Bishop, there had existed in Jean Valjean a profoundhesitation in the presence of any violence, even when directed againsthimself.Suicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which maycontain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible to JeanValjean.At the entrance to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, the carriage halted, the waybeing too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. Javert and JeanValjean alighted.The coachman humbly represented to "monsieur l'Inspecteur," that theUtrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of theassassinated man, and with mire from the assassin. That is the way heunderstood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. At the same time,drawing his certificate book from his pocket, he begged the inspector tohave the goodness to write him "a bit of an attestation."Javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, andsaid:"How much do you want, including your time of waiting and the drive?""It comes to seven hours and a quarter," replied the man, "and my velvetwas perfectly new. Eighty francs, Mr. Inspector."Javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage.Jean Valjean fancied that it was Javert's intention to conduct him onfoot to the post of the Blancs-Manteaux or to the post of the Archives,both of which are close at hand.They entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed JeanValjean. They reached No. 7. Jean Valjean knocked. The door opened."It is well," said Javert. "Go up stairs."He added with a strange expression, and as though he were exerting aneffort in speaking in this manner:"I will wait for you here."Jean Valjean looked at Javert. This mode of procedure was but little inaccord with Javert's habits. However, he could not be greatly surprisedthat Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him, theconfidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length ofits claws, seeing that Jean Valjean had made up his mind to surrenderhimself and to make an end of it. He pushed open the door, entered thehouse, called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cordfrom his couch: "It is I!" and ascended the stairs.On arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roadshave their stations. The window on the landing-place, which was asash-window, was open. As in many ancient houses, the staircase got itslight from without and had a view on the street. The street-lantern,situated directly opposite, cast some light on the stairs, and thuseffected some economy in illumination.Jean Valjean, either for the sake of getting the air, or mechanically,thrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. Itis short, and the lantern lighted it from end to end. Jean Valjean wasoverwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer any one there.Javert had taken his departure.CHAPTER XII--THE GRANDFATHERBasque and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, as hestill lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon which he had beenplaced on his arrival. The doctor who had been sent for had hastenedthither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.Aunt Gillenormand went and came, in affright, wringing her hands andincapable of doing anything but saying: "Heavens! is it possible?" Attimes she added: "Everything will be covered with blood." When her firsthorror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the situation penetratedher mind, and took form in the exclamation: "It was bound to end in thisway!" She did not go so far as: "I told you so!" which is customary onthis sort of occasion. At the physician's orders, a camp bed had beenprepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and after havingfound that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded man had no verydeep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the corners of his lipsproceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, withouta pillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even atrifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration.Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressingMarius, withdrew. She set herself to telling her beads in her ownchamber.The trunk had not suffered any internal injury; a bullet, deadened bythe pocket-book, had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with ahideous laceration, which was of no great depth, and consequently, notdangerous. The long, underground journey had completed the dislocationof the broken collar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The armshad been slashed with sabre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his face;but his head was fairly covered with cuts; what would be the result ofthese wounds on the head? Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, orwould they attack the brain? As yet, this could not be decided. A gravesymptom was that they had caused a swoon, and that people do not alwaysrecover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded man had been exhaustedby hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had protected thelower part of the body from injury.Basque and Nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages; Nicolettesewed them, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, forthe time being, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Besidethe bed, three candles burned on a table where the case of surgicalinstruments lay spread out. The doctor bathed Marius' face and hair withcold water. A full pail was reddened in an instant. The porter, candlein hand, lighted them.The doctor seemed to be pondering sadly. From time to time, he made anegative sign with his head, as though replying to some question whichhe had inwardly addressed to himself.A bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctorwith himself.At the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius' face, and lightlytouching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened at the endof the drawing-room, and a long, pallid figure made its appearance.This was the grandfather.The revolt had, for the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged andengrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had not been able to sleepon the previous night, and he had been in a fever all day long. In theevening, he had gone to bed very early, recommending that everything inthe house should be well barred, and he had fallen into a doze throughsheer fatigue.Old men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand's chamber adjoined thedrawing-room, and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken,the noise had awakened him. Surprised at the rift of light which hesaw under his door, he had risen from his bed, and had groped his waythither.He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of thehalf-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering,his body wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and asdestitute of folds as a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantomwho is gazing into a tomb.He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white witha waxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid lips,stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionlessand brilliantly lighted up.The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossifiedlimbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneae were yellow on account ofhis great age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his wholeface assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fellpendent, as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayedby the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which quiveredall over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing, throughthe opening in his dressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs, allbristling with white hairs, and he murmured:"Marius!""Sir," said Basque, "Monsieur has just been brought back. He went to thebarricade, and . . .""He is dead!" cried the old man in a terrible voice. "Ah! The rascal!"Then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up thiscentenarian as erect as a young man."Sir," said he, "you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. Heis dead, is he not?"The doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent.M. Gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter."He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself killed onthe barricades! Out of hatred to me! He did that to spite me! Ah! Youblood-drinker! This is the way he returns to me! Misery of my life, heis dead!"He went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling,and, erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, to thenight:"Pierced, sabred, exterminated, slashed, hacked in pieces! Just look atthat, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting for him, and that Ihad had his room arranged, and that I had placed at the head of my bedhis portrait taken when he was a little child! He knew well that he hadonly to come back, and that I had been recalling him for years, and thatI remained by my fireside, with my hands on my knees, not knowing whatto do, and that I was mad over it! You knew well, that you had but toreturn and to say: 'It is I,' and you would have been the master of thehouse, and that I should have obeyed you, and that you could have donewhatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you knewthat well, and you said:"No, he is a Royalist, I will not go! And you went to the barricades,and you got yourself killed out of malice! To revenge yourself for whatI said to you about Monsieur le Duc de Berry. It is infamous! Go to bedthen and sleep tranquilly! he is dead, and this is my awakening."The doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, quittedMarius for a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, and took his arm.The grandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemedexaggerated in size and bloodshot, and said to him calmly:"I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death ofLouis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible and that isto think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You willhave scribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes, discussions,progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of the press,and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you. Ah!Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, thescamp! Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe? Oh! I know you well.I see your cabriolet pass my window. I am going to tell you. You arewrong to think that I am angry. One does not fly into a rage against adead man. That would be stupid. This is a child whom I have reared.I was already old while he was very young. He played in the Tuileriesgarden with his little shovel and his little chair, and in order thatthe inspectors might not grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made inthe earth with his shovel, with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down withLouis XVIII.! and off he went. It was no fault of mine. He was all rosyand blond. His mother is dead. Have you ever noticed that all littlechildren are blond? Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigandsof the Loire, but children are innocent of their fathers' crimes.I remember when he was no higher than that. He could not manageto pronounce his Ds. He had a way of talking that was so sweet andindistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping. Iremember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed acircle to admire him and marvel at him, he was so handsome, was thatchild! He had a head such as you see in pictures. I talked in a deepvoice, and I frightened him with my cane, but he knew very well that itwas only to make him laugh. In the morning, when he entered my room, Igrumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all the same. One cannotdefend oneself against those brats. They take hold of you, they hold youfast, they never let you go again. The truth is, that there never was acupid like that child. Now, what can you say for your Lafayettes, yourBenjamin Constants, and your Tirecuir de Corcelles who have killed him?This cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion."He approached Marius, who still lay livid and motionless, and to whomthe physician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. Theold man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted thepassage of words that were barely audible, like breaths in the deathagony:"Ah! heartless lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretch! Ah! Septembrist!"Reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse.Little by little, as it is always indispensable that internal eruptionsshould come to the light, the sequence of words returned, but thegrandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them, hisvoice was so weak, and extinct, that it seemed to come from the otherside of an abyss:"It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. Andto think that there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have beendelighted to make this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of amusinghimself and enjoying life, went off to fight and get himself shot downlike a brute! And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going todance at the Chaumiere, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What'sthe use of being twenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly!Poor mothers, beget fine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make twofunerals under the same carriage gate. So you have got yourself arrangedlike this for the sake of General Lamarque's handsome eyes! What hadthat General Lamarque done to you? A slasher! A chatter-box! To getoneself killed for a dead man! If that isn't enough to drive any onemad! Just think of it! At twenty! And without so much as turning hishead to see whether he was not leaving something behind him! That's theway poor, good old fellows are forced to die alone, now-adays. Perishin your corner, owl! Well, after all, so much the better, that is whatI was hoping for, this will kill me on the spot. I am too old, I ama hundred years old, I am a hundred thousand years old, I ought, byrights, to have been dead long ago. This blow puts an end to it. So allis over, what happiness! What is the good of making him inhale ammoniaand all that parcel of drugs? You are wasting your trouble, you fool ofa doctor! Come, he's dead, completely dead. I know all about it, Iam dead myself too. He hasn't done things by half. Yes, this age isinfamous, infamous and that's what I think of you, of your ideas, ofyour systems, of your masters, of your oracles, of your doctors, of yourscape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers, and of all therevolutions which, for the last sixty years, have been frighteningthe flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in gettingyourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over your death, doyou understand, you assassin?"At that moment, Marius slowly opened his eyes, and his glance, stilldimmed by lethargic wonder, rested on M. Gillenormand."Marius!" cried the old man. "Marius! My little Marius! my child! mywell-beloved son! You open your eyes, you gaze upon me, you are alive,thanks!"And he fell fainting.BOOK FOURTH.--JAVERT DERAILEDCHAPTER I--JAVERTJavert passed slowly down the Rue de l'Homme Arme.He walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, andlikewise, for the first time in his life, with his hands behind hisback.Up to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon's attitudes, only thatwhich is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the chest;that which is expressive of uncertainty--with the hands behind theback--had been unknown to him. Now, a change had taken place; his wholeperson, slow and sombre, was stamped with anxiety.He plunged into the silent streets.Nevertheless, he followed one given direction.He took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes,skirted the quay, passed the Greve, and halted at some distance fromthe post of the Place du Chatelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame.There, between the Notre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand,and the Quai de la Megisserie and the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, theSeine forms a sort of square lake, traversed by a rapid.This point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is moredangerous than this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, and irritated bythe piles of the mill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges,situated thus close together, augment the peril; the water hurries informidable wise through the arches. It rolls in vast and terrible waves;it accumulates and piles up there; the flood attacks the piles of thebridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes.Men who fall in there never re-appear; the best of swimmers are drownedthere.Javert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in bothhands, and, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance ofhis whiskers, he meditated.A novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in thedepths of his being; and he had something upon which to examine himself.Javert was undergoing horrible suffering.For several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled;that brain, so limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; thatcrystal was clouded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience, andhe could not conceal the fact from himself. When he had so unexpectedlyencountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there had been inhim something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey, and of thedog who finds his master again.He beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, but he beheldtwo; and that terrified him; him, who had never in all his life knownmore than one straight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this, thatthe two paths were contrary to each other. One of these straight linesexcluded the other. Which of the two was the true one?His situation was indescribable.To owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt and to repay it; tobe, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, and torepay his service with another service; to allow it to be said to him,"Go," and to say to the latter in his turn: "Be free"; to sacrifice topersonal motives duty, that general obligation, and to be conscious,in those personal motives, of something that was also general, and,perchance, superior, to betray society in order to remain true to hisconscience; that all these absurdities should be realized and shouldaccumulate upon him,--this was what overwhelmed him.One thing had amazed him,--this was that Jean Valjean should have donehim a favor, and one thing petrified him,--that he, Javert, should havedone Jean Valjean a favor.Where did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, and could nolonger find his bearings.What was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; to leave JeanValjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of authority felllower than the man of the galleys, in the second, a convict rose abovethe law, and set his foot upon it. In both cases, dishonor for him,Javert. There was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive.Destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from theimpossible, and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice.Javert had reached one of those extremities.One of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. The veryviolence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought wassomething to which he was unused, and which was peculiarly painful.In thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion;and it irritated him to have that within him.Thought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of hisfunctions, would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue;thought on the day which had just passed was a torture. Nevertheless, itwas indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience, aftersuch shocks, and render to himself an account of himself.What he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit todecide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to thewhole social and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code,upon a release; this had suited him; he had substituted his own affairsfor the affairs of the public; was not this unjustifiable? Every timethat he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name whichhe had committed, he trembled from head to foot. Upon what should hedecide? One sole resource remained to him; to return in all haste tothe Rue de l'Homme Arme, and commit Jean Valjean to prison. It was clearthat that was what he ought to do. He could not.Something barred his way in that direction.Something? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of thetribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javertwas overwhelmed.A galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law!And that the deed of Javert!Was it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made toproceed with vigor, the man made to submit,--that these two men who wereboth the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, that bothof them had set themselves above the law? What then! such enormitieswere to happen and no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean, strongerthan the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he, Javert,was to go on eating the government's bread!His revery gradually became terrible.He might, athwart this revery, have also reproached himself onthe subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire; but he never even thought of that. The lesser faultwas lost in the greater. Besides, that insurgent was, obviously, a deadman, and, legally, death puts an end to pursuit.Jean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit.Jean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served him aspoints of support all his life long, had crumbled away in the presenceof this man. Jean Valjean's generosity towards him, Javert, crushed him.Other facts which he now recalled, and which he had formerly treatedas lies and folly, now recurred to him as realities. M. Madeleinere-appeared behind Jean Valjean, and the two figures were superposed insuch fashion that they now formed but one, which was venerable. Javertfelt that something terrible was penetrating his soul--admiration fora convict. Respect for a galley-slave--is that a possible thing? Heshuddered at it, yet could not escape from it. In vain did he struggle,he was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity of thatwretch. This was odious.A benevolent malefactor, merciful, gentle, helpful, clement, a convict,returning good for evil, giving back pardon for hatred, preferring pityto vengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy,saving him who had smitten him, kneeling on the heights of virtue, morenearly akin to an angel than to a man. Javert was constrained to admitto himself that this monster existed.Things could not go on in this manner.Certainly, and we insist upon this point, he had not yielded withoutresistance to that monster, to that infamous angel, to that hideoushero, who enraged almost as much as he amazed him. Twenty times, as hesat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger hadroared within him. A score of times he had been tempted to fling himselfupon Jean Valjean, to seize him and devour him, that is to say, toarrest him. What more simple, in fact? To cry out at the first post thatthey passed:--"Here is a fugitive from justice, who has broken his ban!"to summon the gendarmes and say to them: "This man is yours!" then togo off, leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the rest and not tomeddle further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner of the law;the law may do with him what it will. What could be more just? Javerthad said all this to himself; he had wished to pass beyond, to act, toapprehend the man, and then, as at present, he had not been able to doit; and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towardsJean Valjean's collar, his hand had fallen back again, as beneath anenormous weight, and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice,a strange voice crying to him:--"It is well. Deliver up your savior.Then have the basin of Pontius Pilate brought and wash your claws."Then his reflections reverted to himself and beside Jean Valjeanglorified he beheld himself, Javert, degraded.A convict was his benefactor!But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? He hadthe right to be killed in that barricade. He should have asserted thatright. It would have been better to summon the other insurgents to hissuccor against Jean Valjean, to get himself shot by force.His supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had beenuprooted. The code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand.He had to deal with scruples of an unknown species. There had takenplace within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legalaffirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. To remain in hisformer uprightness did not suffice. A whole order of unexpected factshad cropped up and subjugated him. A whole new world was dawning onhis soul: kindness accepted and repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence,violences committed by pity on austerity, respect for persons, no moredefinitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of a tearin the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God,running in inverse sense to justice according to men. He perceived amidthe shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrifiedand dazzled him. An owl forced to the gaze of an eagle.He said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases,that authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule mightbe inadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could notbe framed within the text of the code, that the unforeseen compelledobedience, that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtueof the functionary, that destiny did indulge in such ambushes, andhe reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortifiedagainst a surprise.He was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist. This convict hadbeen good. And he himself, unprecedented circumstance, had just beengood also. So he was becoming depraved.He found that he was a coward. He conceived a horror of himself.Javert's ideal, was not to be human, to be grand, to be sublime; it wasto be irreproachable.Now, he had just failed in this.How had he come to such a pass? How had all this happened? He could nothave told himself. He clasped his head in both hands, but in spite ofall that he could do, he could not contrive to explain it to himself.He had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring JeanValjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of whichhe, Javert, was the slave. Not for a single instant while he held himin his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea ofreleasing him. It was, in some sort, without his consciousness, that hishand had relaxed and had let him go free.All sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes. He putquestions to himself, and made replies to himself, and his repliesfrightened him. He asked himself: "What has that convict done, thatdesperate fellow, whom I have pursued even to persecution, and who hashad me under his foot, and who could have avenged himself, and whoowed it both to his rancor and to his safety, in leaving me my life, inshowing mercy upon me? His duty? No. Something more. And I in showingmercy upon him in my turn--what have I done? My duty? No. Somethingmore. So there is something beyond duty?" Here he took fright; hisbalance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, theother rose heavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one whichwas on high than by the one which was below. Without being in the leastin the world what is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous,being, on the contrary, respectful by instinct, towards the establishedchurch, he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole; orderwas his dogma, and sufficed for him; ever since he had attained to man'sestate and the rank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all hisreligion in the police. Being,--and here we employ words without theleast irony and in their most serious acceptation, being, as we havesaid, a spy as other men are priests. He had a superior, M. Gisquet; upto that day he had never dreamed of that other superior, God.This new chief, God, he became unexpectedly conscious of, and he feltembarrassed by him. This unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings;he did not know what to do with this superior, he, who was not ignorantof the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow, that he mustnot disobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, and that, in the presence of asuperior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior has no other resourcethan that of handing in his resignation.But how was he to set about handing in his resignation to God?However things might stand,--and it was to this point that he revertedconstantly,--one fact dominated everything else for him, and that was,that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law. He had justshut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban. He had justset a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the laws of a man whobelonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer understoodhimself. The very reasons for his action escaped him; only their vertigowas left with him. Up to that moment he had lived with that blind faithwhich gloomy probity engenders. This faith had quitted him, this probityhad deserted him. All that he had believed in melted away. Truths whichhe did not wish to recognize were besieging him, inexorably. Henceforth,he must be a different man. He was suffering from the strange pains ofa conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that whichit was repugnant to him to behold. He felt himself emptied, useless, putout of joint with his past life, turned out, dissolved. Authority wasdead within him. He had no longer any reason for existing.A terrible situation! to be touched.To be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in onepiece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the factthat one cherishes beneath one's breast of bronze something absurdand disobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass ofreturning good for good, although one has said to oneself up to that daythat that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the intruder'shand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand!to suddenly feel one's fingers opening! to relax one's grip,--what aterrible thing!The man-projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating!To be obliged to confess this to oneself: infallibility is notinfallible, there may exist error in the dogma, all has not been saidwhen a code speaks, society is not perfect, authority is complicatedwith vacillation, a crack is possible in the immutable, judges are butmen, the law may err, tribunals may make a mistake! to behold a rift inthe immense blue pane of the firmament!That which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinearconscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity whichhad been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breakingagainst God. It certainly was singular that the stoker of order, thatthe engineer of authority, mounted on the blind iron horse with itsrigid road, could be unseated by a flash of light! that the immovable,the direct, the correct, the geometrical, the passive, the perfect,could bend! that there should exist for the locomotive a road toDamascus!God, always within man, and refractory, He, the true conscience, to thefalse; a prohibition to the spark to die out; an order to the ray toremember the sun; an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritableabsolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute, humanitywhich cannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; that splendidphenomenon, the finest, perhaps, of all our interior marvels, did Javertunderstand this? Did Javert penetrate it? Did Javert account for itto himself? Evidently he did not. But beneath the pressure of thatincontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting.He was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. In allthis he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. It seemedto him that, henceforth, his respiration was repressed forever. He wasnot accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head.Up to this point, everything above him had been, to his gaze, merely asmooth, limpid and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible,nothing obscure; nothing that was not defined, regularly disposed,linked, precise, circumscribed, exact, limited, closed, fully providedfor; authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it, nodizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown exceptfrom below. The irregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening ofchaos, the possible slip over a precipice--this was the work of thelower regions, of rebels, of the wicked, of wretches. Now Javert threwhimself back, and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedentedapparition: a gulf on high.What! one was dismantled from top to bottom! one was disconcerted,absolutely! In what could one trust! That which had been agreed upon wasgiving way! What! the defect in society's armor could be discovered bya magnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor of the law could suddenlyfind himself caught between two crimes--the crime of allowing a man toescape and the crime of arresting him! everything was not settled inthe orders given by the State to the functionary! There might beblind alleys in duty! What,--all this was real! was it true that anex-ruffian, weighed down with convictions, could rise erect and end bybeing in the right? Was this credible? were there cases in which the lawshould retire before transfigured crime, and stammer its excuses?--Yes,that was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and Javert hadtouched it! and not only could he not deny it, but he had taken partin it. These were realities. It was abominable that actual facts couldreach such deformity. If facts did their duty, they would confinethemselves to being proofs of the law; facts--it is God who sends them.Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high?Thus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusionof consternation, all that might have corrected and restrained thisimpression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and theuniverse were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple andterrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force dueto legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy,the government, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legalinfallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which restpolitical and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, allthis was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spyof order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dogprovidence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, atthe summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and ahalo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he hadcome; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.Was this to be endured? No.A violent state, if ever such existed. There were only two ways ofescaping from it. One was to go resolutely to Jean Valjean, and restoreto his cell the convict from the galleys. The other . . .Javert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, betookhimself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated by alantern at one of the corners of the Place du Chatelet.On arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, andhe entered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way in which theyopen the door of a station-house. Javert mentioned his name, showed hiscard to the sergeant, and seated himself at the table of the post onwhich a candle was burning. On a table lay a pen, a leaden inkstand andpaper, provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of thenight patrols. This table, still completed by its straw-seated chair,is an institution; it exists in all police stations; it is invariablyornamented with a box-wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer boxof cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest stage ofofficial style. It is there that the literature of the State has itsbeginning.Javert took a pen and a sheet of paper, and began to write. This is whathe wrote:      A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE. "In the first place:  I beg Monsieur le Prefet to cast his eyes on this. "Secondly:  prisoners, on arriving after examination, take off their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched.  Many of them cough on their return to prison. This entails hospital expenses. "Thirdly:  the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance, is good, but, on important occasions, it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other, so that, in case one agent should, for any cause, grow weak in his service, the other may supervise him and take his place. "Fourthly:  it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the Madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair, even by paying for it. "Fifthly:  in the Madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen, so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand. "Sixthly:  the prisoners called barkers, who summon the other prisoners to the parlor, force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly.  This is a theft. "Seventhly:  for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop; this is an abuse of the contractor, since the cloth is none the worse for it. "Eighthly:  it is annoying for visitors to La Force to be obliged to traverse the boys' court in order to reach the parlor of Sainte-Marie-l'Egyptienne. "Ninthly:  it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the court-yard of the prefecture the interrogations put by the magistrates to prisoners.  For a gendarme, who should be sworn to secrecy, to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder. "Tenthly:  Mme. Henry is an honest woman; her canteen is very neat; but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse-trap of the secret cells.  This is unworthy of the Conciergerie of a great civilization." Javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography, not omitting a single comma, and making the paper screech under his pen. Below the last line he signed:                                               "JAVERT,                                    "Inspector of the 1st class.       "The Post of the Place du Chatelet.                 "June 7th, 1832, about one o'clock in the morning."Javert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter, sealedit, wrote on the back: Note for the administration, left it on thetable, and quitted the post. The glazed and grated door fell to behindhim.Again he traversed the Place du Chatelet diagonally, regained the quay,and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he hadabandoned a quarter of an hour previously, leaned on his elbows andfound himself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone of theparapet. He did not appear to have stirred.The darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which followsmidnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a single lightburned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; all of the streetsand quays which could be seen were deserted; Notre-Dame and the towersof the Court-House seemed features of the night. A street lanternreddened the margin of the quay. The outlines of the bridges layshapeless in the mist one behind the other. Recent rains had swollen theriver.The spot where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, situatedprecisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above thatformidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves againlike an endless screw.Javert bent his head and gazed. All was black. Nothing was to bedistinguished. A sound of foam was audible; but the river could not beseen. At moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, andundulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no oneknows whence, and converting it into a snake. The light vanished, andall became indistinct once more. Immensity seemed thrown open there.What lay below was not water, it was a gulf. The wall of the quay,abrupt, confused, mingled with the vapors, instantly concealed fromsight, produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite. Nothing wasto be seen, but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor ofthe wet stones could be felt. A fierce breath rose from this abyss. Theflood in the river, divined rather than perceived, the tragic whisperingof the waves, the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge, theimaginable fall into that gloomy void, into all that shadow was full ofhorror.Javert remained motionless for several minutes, gazing at this openingof shadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembledattention. The water roared. All at once he took off his hat and placedit on the edge of the quay. A moment later, a tall black figure, whicha belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom,appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards theSeine, then drew itself up again, and fell straight down into theshadows; a dull splash followed; and the shadow alone was in the secretof the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneaththe water.BOOK FIFTH.--GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHERCHAPTER I--IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAINSome time after the events which we have just recorded, SieurBoulatruelle experienced a lively emotion.Sieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom the readerhas already seen in the gloomy parts of this book.Boulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man whowas occupied with divers and troublesome matters. He broke stones anddamaged travellers on the highway.Road-mender and thief as he was, he cherished one dream; he believed inthe treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped some day tofind the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, helived to search the pockets of passers-by.Nevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escapedneatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette'sgarret in company with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: hisdrunkenness had been his salvation. The authorities had never been ableto make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or aman who had been robbed. An order of nolle prosequi, founded on his wellauthenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, hadset him at liberty. He had taken to his heels. He had returned to hisroad from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under administrative supervision,broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a verypensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addictednone the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.As for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time afterhis return to his road-mender's turf-thatched cot, here it is:One morning, Boulatruelle, while on his way as was his wont, to hiswork, and possibly also to his ambush, a little before daybreak caughtsight, through the branches of the trees, of a man, whose back alonehe saw, but the shape of whose shoulders, as it seemed to him at thatdistance and in the early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar to him.Boulatruelle, although intoxicated, had a correct and lucid memory, adefensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflictwith legal order."Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?" he saidto himself. But he could make himself no answer, except that the manresembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace.However, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,Boulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man didnot belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot,evidently. No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour.He had walked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very great distance;for he had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why washe in these woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he comethere for?Boulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory,he recalled in a vague way that he had already, many years before, hada similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effectthat he might well be this very individual."By the deuce," said Boulatruelle, "I'll find him again. I'll discoverthe parish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has areason, and I'll know it. People can't have secrets in my forest if Idon't have a finger in the pie."He took his pick-axe which was very sharply pointed."There now," he grumbled, "is something that will search the earth and aman."And, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line ofmarch at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, andset out across the thickets.When he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was alreadybeginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in thesand, weeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young branchesin the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves upagain with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman whostretches herself when she wakes, pointed out to him a sort of track. Hefollowed it, then lost it. Time was flying. He plunged deeper into thewoods and came to a sort of eminence. An early huntsman who was passingin the distance along a path, whistling the air of Guillery, suggestedto him the idea of climbing a tree. Old as he was, he was agile. Therestood close at hand a beech-tree of great size, worthy of Tityrus and ofBoulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able.The idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste on the sidewhere the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild, Boulatruelle suddenlycaught sight of his man.Hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him.The man entered, or rather, glided into, an open glade, at aconsiderable distance, masked by large trees, but with whichBoulatruelle was perfectly familiar, on account of having noticed, neara large pile of porous stones, an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged witha sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. This glade was the onewhich was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones, destinedfor no one knows what employment, which was visible there thirty yearsago, is doubtless still there. Nothing equals a heap of stones inlongevity, unless it is a board fence. They are temporary expedients.What a reason for lasting!Boulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descendedfrom the tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize thebeast. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there.It was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, whichindulge in a thousand teasing zigzags, it required a good quarter of anhour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is peculiarly dense,very thorny, and very aggressive in that locality, a full half hour wasnecessary. Boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this.He believed in the straight line; a respectable optical illusion whichruins many a man. The thicket, bristling as it was, struck him as thebest road."Let's take to the wolves' Rue de Rivoli," said he.Boulatruelle, accustomed to taking crooked courses, was on this occasionguilty of the fault of going straight.He flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth.He had to deal with holly bushes, nettles, hawthorns, eglantines,thistles, and very irascible brambles. He was much lacerated.At the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged totraverse.At last he reached the Blaru-bottom, after the lapse of forty minutes,sweating, soaked, breathless, scratched, and ferocious.There was no one in the glade. Boulatruelle rushed to the heap ofstones. It was in its place. It had not been carried off.As for the man, he had vanished in the forest. He had made his escape.Where? in what direction? into what thicket? Impossible to guess.And, heartrending to say, there, behind the pile of stones, in front ofthe tree with the sheet of zinc, was freshly turned earth, a pick-axe,abandoned or forgotten, and a hole.The hole was empty."Thief!" shrieked Boulatruelle, shaking his fist at the horizon.CHAPTER II--MARIUS, EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR DOMESTICWARFor a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many weeks helay in a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebralsymptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than bythe wounds themselves.He repeated Cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacityof fever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some ofthe lesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large woundsbeing always liable to become re-absorbed, and consequently, to killthe sick man, under certain atmospheric conditions; at every change ofweather, at the slightest storm, the physician was uneasy."Above all things," he repeated, "let the wounded man be subjected to noemotion." The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult,the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having beeninvented as yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet "as big as theceiling," as she put it, for lint. It was not without difficultythat the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame thegangrene. As long as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated indespair at his grandson's pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nordead.Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman withwhite hair,--such was the description given by the porter,--came toinquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for thedressings.Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after thesorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in adying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer for Marius.Convalescence began. But Marius was forced to remain for two months morestretched out on a long chair, on account of the results called up bythe fracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like thatwhich will not close, and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely, tothe great annoyance of the sick person.However, this long illness and this long convalescence saved himfrom all pursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a publiccharacter, which six months will not extinguish. Revolts, in the presentstate of society, are so much the fault of every one, that they arefollowed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes.Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctorsto lodge information against the wounded, having outraged publicopinion, and not opinion alone, but the King first of all, the woundedwere covered and protected by this indignation; and, with the exceptionof those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat, thecouncils of war did not dare to trouble any one. So Marius was left inpeace.M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and thenthrough every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent hispassing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big arm-chaircarried to Marius' bedside; he required his daughter to take thefinest linen in the house for compresses and bandages. MademoiselleGillenormand, like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare thefine linen, while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed.M. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him, that for thepreparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen,nor new linen as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of thewounds from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself.When the dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: "Aie! aie!"Nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle, senile palsy,offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed thedoctor with questions. He did not observe that he asked the same onesover and over again.On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out ofdanger, the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present ofthree louis. That evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danceda gavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang thefollowing song:      "Jeanne est nee a Fougere     "Amour, tu vis en elle;       Vrai nid d'une bergere;       Car c'est dans sa prunelle       J'adore son jupon,            Que tu mets ton carquois.           Fripon.                       Narquois!                "Moi, je la chante, et j'aime,                 Plus que Diane meme,                 Jeanne et ses durs tetons                     Bretons."[61]"Love, thou dwellest in her; For 'tis in her eyes that thou placest thyquiver, sly scamp!"As for me, I sing her, and I love, more than Diana herself, Jeanne andher firm Breton breasts."Then he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching him through thehalf-open door, made sure that he was praying.Up to that time, he had not believed in God.At each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more and morepronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of mechanicalactions full of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs, withoutknowing why. A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning atreceiving a big bouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it toher. The husband made a jealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried to drawNicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, "M. le Baron." He shouted:"Long live the Republic!"Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: "Is he no longer in danger?"He gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over himwhile he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himselfan account of himself. Marius was the master of the house, there wasabdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable ofchildren. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent,he stepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted,charming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gayradiance of his visage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it isadorable. There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age.As for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him,he had but one fixed idea: Cosette.After the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounceher name, and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought ofher. He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there.He did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of theRue de la Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that werealmost indistinct, floated through his mind, Eponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf,the Thenardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smokeof the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through thatadventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; heunderstood nothing connected with his own life, he did not know how norby whom he had been saved, and no one of those around him knew this; allthat they had been able to tell him was, that he had been brought homeat night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; past,present, future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea;but in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear and preciseoutline, something made of granite, a resolution, a will; to findCosette once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from theidea of Cosette. He had decreed in his heart that he would not acceptthe one without the other, and he was immovably resolved to exact ofany person whatever, who should desire to force him to live,--from hisgrandfather, from fate, from hell,--the restitution of his vanishedEden.He did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.Let us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and was but littlesoftened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. Inthe first place, he was not in the secret; then, in his reveries ofan invalid, which were still feverish, possibly, he distrusted thistenderness as a strange and novel thing, which had for its object hisconquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely wasted his poorold smile. Marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he,Marius, did not speak, and let things take their course; but that whenit became a question of Cosette, he would find another face, and thathis grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked. Then there wouldbe an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, aconfrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner ofobjections at one and the same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune,poverty, a stone about his neck, the future. Violent resistance;conclusion: a refusal. Marius stiffened himself in advance.And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of hismemory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, ColonelPontmercy placed himself once more between M. Gillenormand and him,Marius, he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect froma person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father. Andwith health, there returned to him a sort of harshness towards hisgrandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand,without however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever sincethe latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness,had not once called him father. It is true that he did not say"monsieur" to him; but he contrived not to say either the one or theother, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously, acrisis was approaching.As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before givingbattle, by way of proving himself. This is called "feeling the ground."One morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly ofthe Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into hishands, and gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste andRobespierre.--"The men of '93 were giants," said Marius with severity.The old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during the remainderof that day.Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather ofhis early years, interpreted this silence as a profound concentrationof wrath, augured from it a hot conflict, and augmented his preparationsfor the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind.He decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages,dislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds whichhe had left, and would reject all food. His wounds were his munitions ofwar. He would have Cosette or die.He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.That moment arrived.CHAPTER III--MARIUS ATTACKEDOne day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order thephials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and saidto him in his tenderest accents: "Look here, my little Marius, if I werein your place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. A fried soleis excellent to begin a convalescence with, but a good cutlet is neededto put a sick man on his feet."Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collectedthe whole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his twoclenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in theface, assumed a terrible air, and said:"This leads me to say something to you.""What is it?""That I wish to marry.""Agreed," said his grandfather.--And he burst out laughing."How agreed?""Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl."Marius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled inevery limb.M. Gillenormand went on:"Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. She comesevery day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Eversince you were wounded, she has passed her time in weeping and makinglint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No.7. Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you shall haveher. You're caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said toyourself:--'I'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, tothat mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau,to that Dorante turned Geronte; he has indulged in his frivolities also,that he has, and he has had his love affairs, and his grisettes and hisCosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, he has eaten ofthe bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.' Ah! you take thecockchafer by the horns. That's good. I offer you a cutlet and youanswer me: 'By the way, I want to marry.' There's a transition foryou! Ah! you reckoned on a bickering! You do not know that I am an oldcoward. What do you say to that? You are vexed? You did not expect tofind your grandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wastingthe discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that'svexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I'll do whateveryou wish, and that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made myinquiries, I'm cunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is nottrue about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she's a jewel, sheadores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, hercoffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since youhave been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, but it is onlyin romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsomeyoung wounded men who interest them. It is not done. What would youraunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the time, my goodfellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if there wasany possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctorhave said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever. In short, it'sall right, let us say no more about it, all's said, all's done, it's allsettled, take her. Such is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that youdid not love me. I said to myself: 'Here now, I have my little Cosetteright under my hand, I'm going to give her to him, he will be obligedto love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.' Ah! so youthought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice,to shout no, and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit of it.Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take thetrouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my well-beloved child."That said, the old man burst forth into sobs.And he seized Marius' head, and pressed it with both arms against hisbreast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supremehappiness."Father!" cried Marius."Ah, so you love me!" said the old man.An ineffable moment ensued. They were choking and could not speak.At length the old man stammered:"Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: 'Father' to me."Marius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms, and said gently:"But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might seeher.""Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow.""Father!""What?""Why not to-day?""Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me 'father' threetimes, and it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall be broughthither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This isthe ending of the elegy of the 'Jeune Malade' by Andre Chenier, by AndreChenier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of '93."M. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part ofMarius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening to him,and who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793.The grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced AndreChenier, resumed precipitately:"Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the greatrevolutionary geniuses, who were not malicious, that is incontestable,who were heroes, pardi! found that Andre Chenier embarrassed themsomewhat, and they had him guillot . . . that is to say, those greatmen on the 7th of Thermidor, besought Andre Chenier, in the interests ofpublic safety, to be so good as to go . . ."M. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could notproceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while hisdaughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with somany emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity ashis age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and,purple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from hishead, he found himself nose to nose with honest Basque, who was blackingboots in the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and shouted fullin his face in fury:--"By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil,those ruffians did assassinate him!""Who, sir?""Andre Chenier!""Yes, sir," said Basque in alarm.CHAPTER IV--MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT ABAD THING THAT M. FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDERHIS ARMCosette and Marius beheld each other once more.What that interview was like we decline to say. There are things whichone must not attempt to depict; the sun is one of them.The entire family, including Basque and Nicolette, were assembled inMarius' chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it.Precisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowinghis nose; he stopped short, holding his nose in his handkerchief, andgazing over it at Cosette.She appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was surroundedby a glory."Adorable!" he exclaimed.Then he blew his nose noisily.Cosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven. She was asthoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness. She stammered allpale, yet flushed, she wanted to fling herself into Marius' arms, anddared not. Ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people. Peopleare pitiless towards happy lovers; they remain when the latter mostdesire to be left alone. Lovers have no need of any people whatever.With Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hairwho was grave yet smiling, though with a vague and heartrending smile.It was "Monsieur Fauchelevent"; it was Jean Valjean.He was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, inperfectly new garments, and with a white cravat.The porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correctbourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring bearer of thecorpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of June,tattered, muddy, hideous, haggard, his face masked in blood and mire,supporting in his arms the fainting Marius; still, his porter's scentwas aroused. When M. Fauchelevent arrived with Cosette, the porter hadnot been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside: "Idon't know why it is, but I can't help fancying that I've seen that facebefore."M. Fauchelevent in Marius' chamber, remained apart near the door. Hehad under his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance to anoctavo volume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was of a greenishhue, and appeared to be mouldy."Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?"Mademoiselle Gillenormand, who did not like books, demanded in a lowtone of Nicolette."Well," retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the sametone, "he's a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? MonsieurBoulard, one of my acquaintances, never walked out without a book underhis arm either, and he always had some old volume hugged to his heartlike that."And, with a bow, he said aloud:"Monsieur Tranchelevent . . ."Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention toproper names was an aristocratic habit of his."Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf of mygrandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, for the hand of Mademoiselle."Monsieur Tranchelevent bowed."That's settled," said the grandfather.And, turning to Marius and Cosette, with both arms extended in blessing,he cried:"Permission to adore each other!"They did not require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! thechirping began. They talked low. Marius, resting on his elbow on hisreclining chair, Cosette standing beside him. "Oh, heavens!" murmuredCosette, "I see you once again! it is thou! it is you! The idea of goingand fighting like that! But why? It is horrible. I have been dead forfour months. Oh! how wicked it was of you to go to that battle! What hadI done to you? I pardon you, but you will never do it again. A littlewhile ago, when they came to tell us to come to you, I still thoughtthat I was about to die, but it was from joy. I was so sad! I have nottaken the time to dress myself, I must frighten people with my looks!What will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar? Do speak!You let me do all the talking. We are still in the Rue de l'Homme Arme.It seems that your shoulder was terrible. They told me that you couldput your fist in it. And then, it seems that they cut your flesh withthe scissors. That is frightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left.It is queer that a person can suffer like that. Your grandfather has avery kindly air. Don't disturb yourself, don't rise on your elbow, youwill injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our unhappiness is over!I am quite foolish. I had things to say to you, and I no longer know inthe least what they were. Do you still love me? We live in the Rue del'Homme Arme. There is no garden. I made lint all the time; stay, sir,look, it is your fault, I have a callous on my fingers.""Angel!" said Marius.Angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. Noother word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it.Then as there were spectators, they paused and said not a word more,contenting themselves with softly touching each other's hands.M. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried:"Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind the scenes.Come, a little uproar, the deuce! so that the children can chatter attheir ease."And, approaching Marius and Cosette, he said to them in a very lowvoice:"Call each other thou. Don't stand on ceremony."Aunt Gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of lightin her elderly household. There was nothing aggressive about thisamazement; it was not the least in the world like the scandalized andenvious glance of an owl at two turtle-doves, it was the stupid eye of apoor innocent seven and fifty years of age; it was a life which had beena failure gazing at that triumph, love."Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior," said her father to her, "I told youthat this is what would happen to you."He remained silent for a moment, and then added:"Look at the happiness of others."Then he turned to Cosette."How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She's a Greuze. So you are goingto have that all to yourself, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, you are gettingoff nicely with me, you are happy; if I were not fifteen years too old,we would fight with swords to see which of us should have her. Come now!I am in love with you, mademoiselle. It's perfectly simple. It is yourright. You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little weddingthis will make! Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament, but I willget a dispensation so that you can be married at Saint-Paul. The churchis better. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more coquettish. It isopposite the fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuitarchitecture is at Namur. It is called Saint-Loup. You must go thereafter you are married. It is worth the journey. Mademoiselle, I am quiteof your mind, I think girls ought to marry; that is what they are madefor. There is a certain Sainte-Catherine whom I should always like tosee uncoiffed.[62] It's a fine thing to remain a spinster, but it ischilly. The Bible says: Multiply. In order to save the people, Jeanned'Arc is needed; but in order to make people, what is needed is MotherGoose. So, marry, my beauties. I really do not see the use in remaininga spinster! I know that they have their chapel apart in the church,and that they fall back on the Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, ahandsome husband, a fine fellow, and at the expiration of a year, abig, blond brat who nurses lustily, and who has fine rolls of fat on histhighs, and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosypaws, laughing the while like the dawn,--that's better than holding acandle at vespers, and chanting Turris eburnea!"The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, andbegan to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more:           "Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries,            Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries."[63]"By the way!""What is it, father?""Have not you an intimate friend?""Yes, Courfeyrac.""What has become of him?""He is dead.""That is good."He seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their fourhands in his aged and wrinkled hands:"She is exquisite, this darling. She's a masterpiece, this Cosette!She is a very little girl and a very great lady. She will only be aBaroness, which is a come down for her; she was born a Marquise. Whateyelashes she has! Get it well fixed in your noddles, my children, thatyou are in the true road. Love each other. Be foolish about it. Love isthe folly of men and the wit of God. Adore each other. Only," he added,suddenly becoming gloomy, "what a misfortune! It has just occurred tome! More than half of what I possess is swallowed up in an annuity; solong as I live, it will not matter, but after my death, a score of yearshence, ah! my poor children, you will not have a sou! Your beautifulwhite hands, Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor of pullinghim by the tail."[64]At this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say:"Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousandfrancs."It was the voice of Jean Valjean.So far he had not uttered a single word, no one seemed to be aware thathe was there, and he had remained standing erect and motionless, behindall these happy people."What has Mademoiselle Euphrasie to do with the question?" inquired thestartled grandfather."I am she," replied Cosette."Six hundred thousand francs?" resumed M. Gillenormand."Minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs, possibly," said JeanValjean.And he laid on the table the package which Mademoiselle Gillenormand hadmistaken for a book.Jean Valjean himself opened the package; it was a bundle of bank-notes.They were turned over and counted. There were five hundred notes for athousand francs each, and one hundred and sixty-eight of five hundred.In all, five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs."This is a fine book," said M. Gillenormand."Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!" murmured the aunt."This arranges things well, does it not, Mademoiselle Gillenormandsenior?" said the grandfather. "That devil of a Marius has ferreted outthe nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams! Just trustto the love affairs of young folks now, will you! Students findstudentesses with six hundred thousand francs. Cherubino works betterthan Rothschild.""Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!" repeated MademoiselleGillenormand, in a low tone. "Five hundred and eighty-four! one might aswell say six hundred thousand!"As for Marius and Cosette, they were gazing at each other while this wasgoing on; they hardly heeded this detail.CHAPTER V--DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARYThe reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a lengthyexplanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had beenable, thanks to his first escape of a few days' duration, to come toParis and to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, thesum earned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, atMontreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might be recaptured,--whicheventually happened--he had buried and hidden that sum in the forestof Montfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum,six hundred and thirty thousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not verybulky, and was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve thebox from dampness, he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnutshavings. In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, theBishop's candlesticks. It will be remembered that he had carried offthe candlesticks when he made his escape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The manseen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean.Later on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went to get itin the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have mentioned. He hada pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himselfalone. When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was athand, when that money might prove of service, he had gone to get it;it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the woods, but onthis occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening. Boulatreulleinherited his pickaxe.The actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, five hundredfrancs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.--"Weshall see hereafter," he thought.The difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousandfrancs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years,from 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had costonly five thousand francs.Jean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where theyglittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.Moreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. Thestory had been told in his presence, and he had verified the fact inthe Moniteur, how a police inspector named Javert had been found drownedunder a boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont au Changeand the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man, otherwiseirreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors, pointed to a fitof mental aberration and a suicide.--"In fact," thought Jean Valjean,"since he left me at liberty, once having got me in his power, he musthave been already mad."CHAPTER VI--THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWNFASHION, TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPYEverything was made ready for the wedding. The doctor, on beingconsulted, declared that it might take place in February. It was thenDecember. A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.The grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for aquarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette."The wonderful, beautiful girl!" he exclaimed. "And she has so sweet andgood an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that Ihave ever seen in my life. Later on, she'll have virtues with an odor ofviolets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with sucha creature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don't go topettifogging, I beg of you."Cosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise.The transition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned,had they not been dazzled by it."Do you understand anything about it?" said Marius to Cosette."No," replied Cosette, "but it seems to me that the good God is caringfor us."Jean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arrangedeverything, made everything easy. He hastened towards Cosette'shappiness with as much ardor, and, apparently with as much joy, asCosette herself.As he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicateproblem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette'scivil status. If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it mightprevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated Cosette from alldifficulties. He concocted for her a family of dead people, a sure meansof not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion of anextinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter ofthe other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners tothe convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; thevery best information and the most respectable references abounded; thegood nuns, not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions ofpaternity, and not attaching any importance to the matter, had neverunderstood exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was thedaughter. They said what was wanted and they said it with zeal. Anacte de notoriete was drawn up. Cosette became in the eyes of the law,Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared an orphan, bothfather and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he wasappointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's guardian, withM. Gillenormand as supervising guardian over him.As for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituteda legacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired toremain unknown. The original legacy had consisted of five hundred andninety-four thousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expendedon the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs of thatamount having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited inthe hands of a third party, was to be turned over to Cosette at hermajority, or at the date of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, wasvery acceptable, as the reader will perceive, especially when the sumdue was half a million. There were some peculiarities here and there,it is true, but they were not noticed; one of the interested partieshad his eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousandfrancs.Cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom shehad so long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another Faucheleventwas her real father. At any other time this would have broken her heart.But at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through, it castbut a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full of joy that thecloud did not last long. She had Marius. The young man arrived, the oldman was effaced; such is life.And then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing enigmasaround her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood is alwaysprepared for certain renunciations.Nevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father.Cosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father Gillenormand.It is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments andpresents. While Jean Valjean was building up for Cosette a normalsituation in society and an unassailable status, M. Gillenormand wassuperintending the basket of wedding gifts. Nothing so amused him asbeing magnificent. He had given to Cosette a robe of Binche guipurewhich had descended to him from his own grandmother."These fashions come up again," said he, "ancient things are therage, and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of mychildhood."He rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer, withswelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.--"Let us hear theconfession of these dowagers," he said, "let us see what they have intheir paunches." He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of allhis wives, of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins,damasks, lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros de Tours, Indiakerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed, dauphines without aright or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alencon point lace,parures in antique goldsmith's work, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamentedwith microscopic battles, gewgaws and ribbons--he lavished everything onCosette. Cosette, amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild withgratitude towards M. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness without limitclothed in satin and velvet. Her wedding basket seemed to her to beupheld by seraphim. Her soul flew out into the azure depths, with wingsof Mechlin lace.The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have alreadysaid, by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish of trumpetswent on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.Every morning, a fresh offering of bric-a-brac from the grandfather toCosette. All possible knickknacks glittered around her.One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of hisbliss, said, apropos of I know not what incident:"The men of the revolution are so great, that they have the prestige ofthe ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each one of them seems to mean antique memory.""Moire antique!" exclaimed the old gentleman. "Thanks, Marius. That isprecisely the idea of which I was in search."And on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored moireantique was added to Cosette's wedding presents.From these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom."Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go withit. The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only thenecessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. Apalace and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grandwaterworks of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess and try to make her aduchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundredthousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far as youcan see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and alsoto the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles drybread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, theuseless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. Iremember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tallas a three-story house which marked the hours, which had the kindness toindicate the hour, but which had not the air of being made for that; andwhich, after having struck midday, or midnight,--midday, the hour of thesun, or midnight, the hour of love,--or any other hour that you like,gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds andfishes, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a host of things which emerged from aniche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, andEponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who playedon the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which itsprinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one's knowingwhy. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal tothat? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg,and I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest."M. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, and allthe fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell through hisdithyrambs."You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how toorganize a day of enjoyment in this age," he exclaimed. "Your nineteenthcentury is weak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores thenoble. In everything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid,colorless, odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your bourgeois whoset up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet,ebony and calico. Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marryingMademoiselle Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness and splendor. A louis d'or hasbeen stuck to a candle. There's the epoch for you. My demand is that Imay flee from it beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that allwas lost, from the day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Leon,Duc de Chabot, Duc de Montbazon, Marquis de Sonbise, Vicomte de Thouars,peer of France, go to Longchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits.In this century, men attend to business, they gamble on 'Change, theywin money, they are stingy. People take care of their surfaces andvarnish them; every one is dressed as though just out of a band-box,washed, soaped, scraped, shaved, combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed,brushed, cleaned on the outside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble,discreet, neat, and at the same time, death of my life, in the depths oftheir consciences they have dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough tomake a cow-herd who blows his nose in his fingers, recoil. I grant tothis age the device: 'Dirty Cleanliness.' Don't be vexed, Marius, giveme permission to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I amalways harping on your people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bitof a slap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lasheswell. Thereupon, I say plainly, that now-a-days people marry, but thatthey no longer know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the graceof the ancient manners. I regret everything about them, their elegance,their chivalry, those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous luxurywhich every one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphonyabove stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyousfaces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, the songs, thefireworks, the frank laughter, the devil's own row, the huge knots ofribbon. I regret the bride's garter. The bride's garter is cousin to thegirdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen's garter,parbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break overthe head of Meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why didAchilles and Hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances?Because Helen allowed Paris to take her garter. With Cosette's garter,Homer would construct the Iliad. He would put in his poem, a loquaciousold fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor. My friends, in bygonedays, in those amiable days of yore, people married wisely; they had agood contract, and then they had a good carouse. As soon as Cujas hadtaken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the stomach isan agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants to have itswedding also. People supped well, and had at table a beautiful neighborwithout a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed. Oh!the large laughing mouths, and how gay we were in those days! youth wasa bouquet; every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuftof roses; whether he was a shepherd or a warrior; and if, by chance,one was a captain of dragoons, one found means to call oneself Florian.People thought much of looking well. They embroidered and tintedthemselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the airof a precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, they had noboots. They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty,coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by theirsides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That was the day of theGalland Indies. One of the sides of that century was delicate, the otherwas magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.To-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoiseis a prude; your century is unfortunate. People would drive away theGraces as being too low in the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed asthough it were ugliness. Since the revolution, everything, including theballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave;your rigadoons are doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. Peoplewould be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in theircravats. The ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries, is toresemble M. Royer-Collard. And do you know what one arrives at withthat majesty? at being petty. Learn this: joy is not only joyous; it isgreat. But be in love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you marry,with fever and giddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of happiness! Begrave in church, well and good. But, as soon as the mass is finished,sarpejou! you must make a dream whirl around the bride. A marriageshould be royal and chimerical; it should promenade its ceremony fromthe cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I have a horrorof a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one day,at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games andLaughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recentlymade bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that uniqueminute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and theeagles, even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into thebourgeoisie of the frogs. Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prunethem of their splendors; don't scrimp on the day when you beam. Thewedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy,it would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here ismy programme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festivalthe rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. Thenuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locksand entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, achariot drawn by marine monsters.     "Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque      Des sons si ravissants qu'il ravissait quiconque!"[65]--there's a festive programme, there's a good one, or else I knownothing of such matters, deuce take it!"While the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening tohimself, Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely ateach other.Aunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity.Within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amountof emotions. Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, Mariusbrought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Mariusreconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius weddinga millionairess. The six hundred thousand francs had been her lastsurprise. Then, her indifference of a girl taking her first communionreturned to her. She went regularly to service, told her beads, read hereuchology, mumbled Aves in one corner of the house, while I love youwas being whispered in the other, and she beheld Marius and Cosette in avague way, like two shadows. The shadow was herself.There is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul,neutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as thebusiness of living, receives no impressions, either human, or pleasantor painful, with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes. Thisdevotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his daughter, corresponds toa cold in the head. You smell nothing of life. Neither any bad, nor anygood odor.Moreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderlyspinster's indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking herso little into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter ofconsent to Marius' marriage. He had acted impetuously, according to hiswont, having, a despot-turned slave, but a single thought,--to satisfyMarius. As for the aunt,--it had not even occurred to him that the auntexisted, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and, sheep asshe was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, butimpassive externally, she had said to herself: "My father has settledthe question of the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle thequestion of the inheritance without consulting him." She was rich, infact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on thispoint. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she wouldhave left him poor. "So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding abeggar, let him be a beggar himself!" But Cosette's half-million pleasedthe aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of loverswere concerned. One owes some consideration to six hundred thousandfrancs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leaveher fortune to these young people, since they did not need it.It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather--M.Gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the finest inthe house. "That will make me young again," he said. "It's an old planof mine. I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in mychamber."He furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. He hadthe ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had byhim in the piece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrechtwith a buttercup-colored satin ground, covered with velvet auriculablossoms.--"It was with that stuff," said he, "that the bed of theDuchesse d'Anville at la Roche-Guyon was draped."--On the chimney-piece,he set a little figure in Saxe porcelain, carrying a muff against hernude stomach.M. Gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study, which Mariusneeded; a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council ofthe order.CHAPTER VII--THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESSThe lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M.Fauchelevent.--"This is reversing things," said MademoiselleGillenormand, "to have the bride come to the house to do the courtinglike this." But Marius' convalescence had caused the habit to becomeestablished, and the arm-chairs of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire,better adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the Rue de l'HommeArme, had rooted it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent saw each other, but didnot address each other. It seemed as though this had been agreed upon.Every girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have come withoutM. Fauchelevent. In Marius' eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the conditionattached to Cosette. He accepted it. By dint of discussing politicalmatters, vaguely and without precision, from the point of view of thegeneral amelioration of the fate of all men, they came to say a littlemore than "yes" and "no." Once, on the subject of education, whichMarius wished to have free and obligatory, multiplied under all formslavished on every one, like the air and the sun in a word, respirablefor the entire population, they were in unison, and they almostconversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even with a certainloftiness of language--still he lacked something indescribable. M.Fauchelevent possessed something less and also something more, than aman of the world.Marius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded withall sorts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simplybenevolent and cold. There were moments when doubts as to his ownrecollections occurred to him. There was a void in his memory, a blackspot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.--Many things had beenlost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether it werereally a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, so serious and so calm aman, in the barricade.This was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and thedisappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposedthat he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory whichforce us, even when happy, even when satisfied, to glance sadly behindus. The head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that havevanished contains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius clasped hisface between his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past traversed thetwilight which reigned in his brain. Again he beheld Mabeuf fall, heheard Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips thecold brow of Eponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre,Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before him, thendispersed into thin air. Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant,charming or tragic beings merely dreams? had they actually existed? Therevolt had enveloped everything in its smoke. These great fevers creategreat dreams. He questioned himself; he felt himself; all these vanishedrealities made him dizzy. Where were they all then? was it really truethat all were dead? A fall into the shadows had carried off all excepthimself. It all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind thecurtain of a theatre. There are curtains like this which drop in life.God passes on to the following act.And he himself--was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, wasrich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marryCosette. It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he hadentered into it black and had emerged from it white, and in that tombthe others had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of thepast, returned and present, formed a circle around him, and overshadowedhim; then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his serenity; but nothingless than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe.M. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings.Marius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade wasthe same as this Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravelybeside Cosette. The first was, probably, one of those nightmaresoccasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium. However,the natures of both men were rigid, no question from Marius to M.Fauchelevent was possible. Such an idea had not even occurred to him. Wehave already indicated this characteristic detail.Two men who have a secret in common, and who, by a sort of tacitagreement, exchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than iscommonly supposed.Once only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into theconversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent,he said to him:"Of course, you are acquainted with that street?""What street?""The Rue de la Chanvrerie.""I have no idea of the name of that street," replied M. Fauchelevent, inthe most natural manner in the world.The response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon thestreet itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it reallywas."Decidedly," thought he, "I have been dreaming. I have been subject toa hallucination. It was some one who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent wasnot there."'CHAPTER VIII--TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FINDMarius' enchantment, great as it was, could not efface from his mindother pre-occupations.While the wedding was in preparation, and while awaiting the date fixedupon, he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to bemade.He owed gratitude in various quarters; he owed it on his father'saccount, he owed it on his own.There was Thenardier; there was the unknown man who had brought him,Marius, back to M. Gillenormand.Marius endeavored to find these two men, not intending to marry, tobe happy, and to forget them, and fearing that, were these debts ofgratitude not discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, whichpromised so brightly for the future.It was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behindhim, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to obtaina quittance from the past.That Thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that hehad saved Colonel Pontmercy. Thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of allthe world except Marius.And Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of Waterloo,was not aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, so far asThenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebtedto the latter for his life, without being indebted to him for anygratitude.None of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in discoveringany trace of Thenardier. Obliteration appeared to be complete inthat quarter. Madame Thenardier had died in prison pending the trial.Thenardier and his daughter Azelma, the only two remaining of thatlamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. The gulf of thesocial unknown had silently closed above those beings. On the surfacethere was not visible so much as that quiver, that trembling, thoseobscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in,and that the plummet may be dropped.Madame Thenardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated from thecase, Claquesous having disappeared, the principal persons accusedhaving escaped from prison, the trial connected with the ambush in theGorbeau house had come to nothing.That affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had beenobliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, aliasPrintanier, alias Bigrenaille, and Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards, whohad been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides ofthe case, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor for life had been thesentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices.Thenardier, the head and leader, had been, through contumacy, likewisecondemned to death.This sentence was the only information remaining about Thenardier,casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside abier.Moreover, by thrusting Thenardier back into the very remotest depths,through a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the densityof the shadows which enveloped this man.As for the other person, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius,the researches were at first to some extent successful, then came toan abrupt conclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage which hadbrought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the6th of June.The coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to thecommands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o'clock in theafternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Elysees, above theoutlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o'clock in the evening,the grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, hadopened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on his shouldersanother man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, who was on the watchat that point, had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man;that, at the order of the police-agent, he, the coachman, had taken "allthose folks" into his carriage; that they had first driven to the Ruedes Filles-du-Calvaire; that they had there deposited the dead man; thatthe dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the coachman, recognizedhim perfectly, although he was alive "this time"; that afterwards, theyhad entered the vehicle again, that he had whipped up his horses; a fewpaces from the gate of the Archives, they had called to him to halt;that there, in the street, they had paid him and left him, and that thepolice-agent had led the other man away; that he knew nothing more; thatthe night had been very dark.Marius, as we have said, recalled nothing. He only remembered that hehad been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when hewas falling backwards into the barricade; then, everything vanished sofar as he was concerned.He had only regained consciousness at M. Gillenormand's.He was lost in conjectures.He could not doubt his own identity. Still, how had it come to passthat, having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been pickedup by the police-agent on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont desInvalides?Some one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to theChamps-Elysees. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion!Some one? Who?This was the man for whom Marius was searching.Of this man, who was his savior, nothing; not a trace; not the faintestindication.Marius, although forced to preserve great reserve, in that direction,pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no morethan elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment.The prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney-coachman.They had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of Juneat the mouth of the Grand Sewer.No report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, whichwas regarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention of this fablewas attributed to the coachman.A coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything, even ofimagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, and Marius could notdoubt it, unless he doubted his own identity, as we have just said.Everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable.What had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman hadseen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his backthe unconscious Marius, and whom the police-agent on the watch hadarrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent? What had become ofthe agent himself?Why had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded in makinghis escape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this man give no sign oflife to Marius, who owed everything to him? His disinterestedness was noless tremendous than his devotion. Why had not that man appeared again?Perhaps he was above compensation, but no one is above gratitude. Was hedead? Who was the man? What sort of a face had he? No one could tell himthis.The coachman answered: "The night was very dark." Basque and Nicolette,all in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered withblood.The porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, hadbeen the only one to take note of the man in question, and this is thedescription that he gave:"That man was terrible."Marius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he had beenbrought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope that it wouldprove of service in his researches.On examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn in asingular way. A piece was missing.One evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette and JeanValjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerableinquiries which he had made, and of the fruitlessness of his efforts.The cold countenance of "Monsieur Fauchelevent" angered him.He exclaimed, with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it:"Yes, that man, whoever he may have been, was sublime. Do you know whathe did, sir? He intervened like an archangel. He must have flung himselfinto the midst of the battle, have stolen me away, have opened thesewer, have dragged me into it and have carried me through it! Hemust have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightfulsubterranean galleries, bent over, weighed down, in the dark, in thecess-pool,--more than a league and a half, sir, with a corpse upon hisback! And with what object? With the sole object of saving the corpse.And that corpse I was. He said to himself: 'There may still be aglimpse of life there, perchance; I will risk my own existence for thatmiserable spark!' And his existence he risked not once but twenty times!And every step was a danger. The proof of it is, that on emerging fromthe sewer, he was arrested. Do you know, sir, that that man did allthis? And he had no recompense to expect. What was I? An insurgent.What was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette's six hundred thousandfrancs were mine . . .""They are yours," interrupted Jean Valjean."Well," resumed Marius, "I would give them all to find that man oncemore."Jean Valjean remained silent.BOOK SIXTH.--THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTCHAPTER I--THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY, 1833The night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessednight. Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night ofMarius and Cosette.The day had been adorable.It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairyspectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of thebridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to beplaced over a door; but it had been sweet and smiling.The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. Francehad not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying offone's wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself withshame from one's happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt withthe delights of the Song of Songs. People had not yet grasped to thefull the chastity, exquisiteness, and decency of jolting their paradisein a posting-chaise, of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs, oftaking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of leaving behind them,in a commonplace chamber, at such a night, the most sacred ofthe souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tete-a-tete of theconductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn.In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are nowliving, the mayor and his scarf, the priest and his chasuble, the lawand God no longer suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion deLonjumeau; a blue waistcoat turned up with red, and with bell buttons,a plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to theNorman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, varnishedhat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip and tall boots. France doesnot yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English nobility,and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail stormof slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes, in memory ofChurchill, afterwards Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed onhis wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck.Old shoes and slippers do not, as yet, form a part of our nuptialcelebrations; but patience, as good taste continues to spread, we shallcome to that.In 1833, a hundred years ago, marriage was not conducted at a full trot.Strange to say, at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding wasa private and social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does notspoil a domestic solemnity, that gayety, even in excess, provided it behonest, and decent, does happiness no harm, and that, in short, it is agood and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whencea family is destined to spring, should begin at home, and that thehousehold should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness.And people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes.The marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this nowsuperannuated fashion, at M. Gillenormand's house.Natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns topublish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, and the churchproduce some complication. They could not get ready before the 16th ofFebruary.Now, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, itchanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples,particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand."Shrove Tuesday!" exclaimed the grandfather, "so much the better. Thereis a proverb:                "'Mariage un Mardi gras                  N'aura point enfants ingrats.'[66]Let us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?""No, certainly not!" replied the lover."Let us marry, then," cried the grandfather.Accordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding thepublic merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the skya tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, evenwhen the rest of creation is under an umbrella.On the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the presenceof M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.As the marriage was taking place under the regime of community ofproperty, the papers had been simple.Henceforth, Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean; Cosette inheritedher and promoted her to the rank of lady's maid.As for Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house hadbeen furnished expressly for him, and Cosette had said to him in suchan irresistible manner: "Father, I entreat you," that she had almostpersuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it.A few days before that fixed on for the marriage, an accident happenedto Jean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. This was not aserious matter; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himselfabout it, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, not even Cosette.Nevertheless, this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage,and to carry his arm in a sling, and had prevented his signing. M.Gillenormand, in his capacity of Cosette's supervising-guardian, hadsupplied his place.We will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to thechurch. One does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent, and one isaccustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it puts a weddingnosegay in its buttonhole. We will confine ourselves to noting anincident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked thetransit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul.At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was inprocess of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue duPare-Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directlyto Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the simplestway was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guestsobserved that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a jamof vehicles.--"Why?" asked M. Gillenormand--"Because of themaskers."--"Capital," said the grandfather, "let us go that way. Theseyoung folks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter theserious part of life. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of themasquerade."They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosetteand Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, stillseparated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come untilthe second. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long procession of vehicleswhich formed an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, andfrom the Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard.In spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew,Pantaloon and Clown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of 1833,Paris had disguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are nolonger to be seen now-a-days. Everything which exists being a scatteredCarnival, there is no longer any Carnival.The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows withcurious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of thetheatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they staredat that procession--peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,--ofvehicles of every description, citadines, tapissieres, carioles,cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by thepolice regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any one inthese vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle. Police-sergeantsmaintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two interminableparallel files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it thatnothing interfered with that double current, those two brooks ofcarriages, flowing, the one down stream, the other up stream, theone towards the Chaussee d'Antin, the other towards the FaubourgSaint-Antoine. The carriages of the peers of France and of theAmbassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, held the middle of the way,going and coming freely. Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notablythat of the Boeuf Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris,England cracked her whip; Lord Seymour's post-chaise, harassed by anickname from the populace, passed with great noise.In the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped likesheep-dogs, honest family coaches, loaded down with great-aunts andgrandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children indisguise, Clowns of seven years of age, Columbines of six, ravishinglittle creatures, who felt that they formed an official part of thepublic mirth, who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade,and who possessed the gravity of functionaries.From time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession ofvehicles; one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knotwas disentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the wholeline. Then they set out again on the march.The wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille,and skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of thePont-aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, theother file, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, halted also. Atthat point of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers.These carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads ofmaskers are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a ShroveTuesday, or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and peoplewould say: "There's something behind that. Probably the ministryis about to undergo a change." A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins andColumbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, all possiblegrotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, Hercules supportingMarquises, fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears justas the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, tow wigs, pink tights,dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer, three-cornered hats of Janottormented with a butterfly, shouts directed at pedestrians, fists onhips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodesty unchained; a chaos ofshamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers; this is whatthat institution was like.Greece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands in need ofthe hackney-coach of Vade.Everything can be parodied, even parody. The Saturnalia, that grimace ofantique beauty, ends, through exaggeration after exaggeration, in ShroveTuesday; and the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays of vine leavesand grapes, inundated with sunshine, displaying her marble breast in adivine semi-nudity, having at the present day lost her shape underthe soaked rags of the North, has finally come to be called theJack-pudding.The tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancientdays of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the bailiff ofthe palace "twenty sous, Tournois, for three coaches of mascaradesin the cross-roads." In our day, these noisy heaps of creatures areaccustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage,whose imperial they load down, or they overwhelm a hired landau, withits top thrown back, with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ridein a carriage intended for six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble,on the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. They even bestride thecarriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees drawn up in aknot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the men's laps. Faraway, above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. Thesecarriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout. Colle,Panard and Piron flow from it, enriched with slang. This carriage whichhas become colossal through its freight, has an air of conquest. Uproarreigns in front, tumult behind. People vociferate, shout, howl, therethey break forth and writhe with enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flamesforth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag; two jades there drag farceblossomed forth into an apotheosis; it is the triumphal car of laughter.A laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, this laughter issuspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving theCarnival to the Parisians.These fishwife vehicles, in which one feels one knows not what shadows,set the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. There onelays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and publicwomen.It certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum totalof gayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people shouldbe enticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids toprostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that thecrowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, halfdung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that theyshould clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that therewould be no festival for the populace, did not the police promenade intheir midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. But what can bedone about it? These be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire areinsulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of allis the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivalsdisaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. Andpopulaces, like tyrants, require buffoons. The King has Roquelaure,the populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great, mad city on everyoccasion that it is a great sublime city. There the Carnival formspart of politics. Paris,--let us confess it--willingly allows infamy tofurnish it with comedy. She only demands of her masters--when she hasmasters--one thing: "Paint me the mud." Rome was of the same mind. Sheloved Nero. Nero was a titanic lighterman.Chance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapelessclusters of masked men and women, dragged about on a vast calash, shouldhalt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train halted on theright. The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriagecontaining the bridal party opposite them on the other side of theboulevard."Hullo!" said a masker, "here's a wedding.""A sham wedding," retorted another. "We are the genuine article."And, being too far off to accost the wedding party, and fearing also,the rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere.At the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had theirhands full, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd's caressto masquerades; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face thethrong with their comrades, and did not find the entire repertory ofprojectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormousverbal attacks of the populace. A frightful exchange of metaphors tookplace between the maskers and the crowd.In the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniardwith an enormous nose, an elderly air, and huge black moustache, and agaunt fishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a loup,[67] hadalso noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-bywere exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice.Their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. The gusts ofrain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open; thebreezes of February are not warm; as the fishwife, clad in a low-neckedgown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, laughed and coughed.Here is their dialogue:"Say, now.""What, daddy?""Do you see that old cove?""What old cove?""Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side.""The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?""Yes.""Well?""I'm sure that I know him.""Ah!""I'm willing that they should cut my throat, and I'm ready to swear thatI never said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don't know thatParisian." [pantinois.]"Paris in Pantin to-day.""Can you see the bride if you stoop down?""No.""And the bridegroom?""There's no bridegroom in that trap.""Bah!""Unless it's the old fellow.""Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low.""I can't.""Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his paw Iknow, and that I'm positive.""And what good does it do to know him?""No one can tell. Sometimes it does!""I don't care a hang for old fellows, that I don't!""I know him.""Know him, if you want to.""How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?""We are in it, too.""Where does that wedding come from?""How should I know?""Listen.""Well, what?""There's one thing you ought to do.""What's that?""Get off of our trap and spin that wedding.""What for?""To find out where it goes, and what it is. Hurry up and jump down,trot, my girl, your legs are young.""I can't quit the vehicle.""Why not?""I'm hired.""Ah, the devil!""I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture.""That's true.""If I leave the cart, the first inspector who gets his eye on me willarrest me. You know that well enough.""Yes, I do.""I'm bought by the government for to-day.""All the same, that old fellow bothers me.""Do the old fellows bother you? But you're not a young girl.""He's in the first carriage.""Well?""In the bride's trap.""What then?""So he is the father.""What concern is that of mine?""I tell you that he's the father.""As if he were the only father.""Listen.""What?""I can't go out otherwise than masked. Here I'm concealed, no one knowsthat I'm here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. It's AshWednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak back into myhole. But you are free.""Not particularly.""More than I am, at any rate.""Well, what of that?""You must try to find out where that wedding-party went to.""Where it went?""Yes.""I know.""Where is it going then?""To the Cadran-Bleu.""In the first place, it's not in that direction.""Well! to la Rapee.""Or elsewhere.""It's free. Wedding-parties are at liberty.""That's not the point at all. I tell you that you must try to learn forme what that wedding is, who that old cove belongs to, and where thatwedding pair lives.""I like that! that would be queer. It's so easy to find out awedding-party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, a weekafterwards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ain't possible!""That don't matter. You must try. You understand me, Azelma."The two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, inopposite directions, and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the"trap" of the bride.CHAPTER II--JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLINGTo realize one's dream. To whom is this accorded? There must beelections for this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown toourselves; the angels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected.Cosette, both at the mayor's office and at church, was dazzling andtouching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her.Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Bincheguipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreathof orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of thatwhiteness she beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor expanding andbecoming transfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her avirgin on the point of turning into a goddess.Marius' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there, beneaththe thick curls, pale lines--the scars of the barricade--were visible.The grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more thanever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch ofBarras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, onaccount of his arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand tothe bride.Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile."Monsieur Fauchelevent," said the grandfather to him, "this is a fineday. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, theremust be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right toexist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgraceto the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good atbottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central governmenthell, otherwise, known as the Devil's Tuileries. Good, here I amuttering demagogical words! As far as I am concerned, I have no longerany political opinions; let all me be rich, that is to say, mirthful,and I confine myself to that."When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronouncedbefore the mayor and before the priest all possible "yesses," afterhaving signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy,after having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by sideunder the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived,hand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white,preceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping thepavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, atthe portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide open,ready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished, Cosettestill could not believe that it was real. She looked at Marius, shelooked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though shefeared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed and uneasy airadded something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They entered thesame carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; M. Gillenormandand Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn onedegree, and was in the second vehicle."My children," said the grandfather, "here you are, Monsieur le Baronand Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres."And Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelicwhisper: "So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou."These two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that irrevocableand irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth andall joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were fortyyears old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two childrenwere two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplateeach other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Mariusperceived Cosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, thetwo apotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows not how, behind acloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was the ideal thing, thereal thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream, the nuptial pillow.All the torments through which they had passed came back to them inintoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleeplessnights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair,converted into caresses and rays of light, rendered still more charmingthe charming hour which was approaching; and that their griefs were butso many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy. How good it isto have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness.The long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension.It was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousnessin Marius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in lowtones: "We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the RuePlumet." The folds of Cosette's gown lay across Marius.Such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality. Onepossesses and one supposes. One still has time before one to divine. Theemotion on that day, of being at mid-day and of dreaming of midnightis indescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon thecrowd, and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gazethrough the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering onCosette's head.Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius,triumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircaseup which he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who hadtrooped to the door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. Therewere flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the church;after the incense, roses. They thought they heard voices carolling inthe infinite; they had God in their hearts; destiny appeared to themlike a ceiling of stars; above their heads they beheld the light of arising sun. All at once, the clock struck. Marius glanced at Cosette'scharming bare arm, and at the rosy things which were vaguely visiblethrough the lace of her bodice, and Cosette, intercepting Marius'glance, blushed to her very hair.Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family hadbeen invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest insaluting her as Madame la Baronne.The officer, Theodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come fromChartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at thewedding of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognize him.He, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider himhandsome, retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any otherwoman."How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!" saidFather Gillenormand, to himself.Cosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. She was in unisonwith Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms andmaxims, she exhaled goodness like a perfume. Happiness desires that allthe world should be happy.She regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections ofvoice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed himwith her smile.A banquet had been spread in the dining-room.Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning ofa great joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They donot consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is nosun, one must be made.The dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the whiteand glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with allsorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid thecandles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces withtriple and quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate,porcelain, faience, pottery, gold and silversmith's work, all wassparkling and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filledin with bouquets, so that where there was not a light, there was aflower.In the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettesby Haydn.Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behindthe door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as tonearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table, Cosettecame, as though inspired by a sudden whim, and made him a deep courtesy,spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands, and with a tenderlyroguish glance, she asked him:"Father, are you satisfied?""Yes," said Jean Valjean, "I am content!""Well, then, laugh."Jean Valjean began to laugh.A few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served.The guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm, enteredthe dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order around thetable.Two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride, thefirst for M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormandtook his seat. The other arm-chair remained empty.They looked about for M. Fauchelevent.He was no longer there.M. Gillenormand questioned Basque."Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?""Sir," replied Basque, "I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told me to sayto you, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand was paining himsomewhat, and that he could not dine with Monsieur le Baron and Madamela Baronne. That he begged to be excused, that he would come to-morrow.He has just taken his departure."That empty arm-chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for amoment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, M. Gillenormand was present,and the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent haddone well to retire early, if he were suffering, but that it was only aslight ailment. This declaration sufficed. Moreover, what is an obscurecorner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and Marius were passingthrough one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no otherfaculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then,an idea occurred to M. Gillenormand.--"Pardieu, this armchair is empty.Come hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she has aright to you. This armchair is for you. That is legal and delightful.Fortunatus beside Fortunata."--Applause from the whole table. Mariustook Jean Valjean's place beside Cosette, and things fell out so thatCosette, who had, at first, been saddened by Jean Valjean's absence,ended by being satisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took hisplace, and was the substitute, Cosette would not have regretted Godhimself. She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius'foot.The arm-chair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; andnothing was lacking.And, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other,was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness.At dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass ofchampagne in his hand--only half full so that the palsy of his eightyyears might not cause an overflow,--proposed the health of the marriedpair."You shall not escape two sermons," he exclaimed. "This morning youhad one from the cure, this evening you shall have one from yourgrandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore eachother. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark,be happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. Philosopherssay: 'Moderate your joys.' I say: 'Give rein to your joys.' Be asmuch smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. Thephilosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff theirphilosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes,too many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many greenleaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much?can people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art toopretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity,in sooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other toomuch, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy?Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdomconsists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happybecause we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancydiamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, orbecause it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life isfull of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy andhappiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obeythe sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, sayswoman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence--women. Ask that demagogue of a Mariusif he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of hisown free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who keepshis place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towards thatroyalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No '89 for Eve. There hasbeen the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been theimperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre ofCharlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis theGreat, which was of gold,--the revolution twisted them between its thumband forefinger, ha'penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lieson the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolutionagainst that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli!I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid? Because it is agewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? And wehave been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you have effectedmuch change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called thecholera-morbus, and because your pourree is called the cachuca. In fact,the women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. Thesefriends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle fromwhich I defy you to escape; and, for my own part, I should be onlytoo happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, thecoquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean, rise in the infinite,calming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumbleas he will, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beastsubmits. We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam tothe very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat onyour face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married.That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Existboldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do thesame, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades offelicity that exist on earth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life.Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one is young!Don't imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my dream, I,too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlightsoul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to along white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixtycenturies men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. Thedevil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man, who is still morecunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good thanthe devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days ofthe terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it isperfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting tobecome Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with eachother, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sunfor Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, letyour fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rainbe your wife's tears. And let it never rain in your household. You havefilched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the greatprize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander it,adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what Isay to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religionto each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte!the best way to adore God is to love one's wife. I love thee! that'smy catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. placessanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris!I don't belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it.This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women!I am old, they say; it's astonishing how much I feel in the mood tobe young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods.Children who contrive to be beautiful and contented,--that intoxicatesme. I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. It isimpossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything but this:to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty,to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one's image inone's little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; thatis the aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used tothink in our day, when we were young folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! whatcharming women there were in those days, and what pretty little facesand what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among them. Then loveeach other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see whatuse there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, Ishould pray the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that heshows us, and to take away from us and put back in his box, the flowers,the birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man'sblessing."The evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather's sovereigngood humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each personregulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. They danceda little, they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding. GoodmanDays of Yore might have been invited to it. However, he was present inthe person of Father Gillenormand.There was a tumult, then silence.The married pair disappeared.A little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.Here we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angelwith his finger on his lips.The soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where thecelebration of love takes place.There should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy whichthey contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls inbrilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that thissacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance tothe infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the manand the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the beingfinal, the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls intoone, ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest;the ravished virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends to God.Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the idealenters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If itwere given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charmingvisions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold theforms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible,bend down, a throng of sombre heads, around the luminous house,satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virginwife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection ofhuman bliss upon their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, thewedded pair, dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone,were to listen, they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling ofwings. Perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels.That dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling. When twomouths, rendered sacred by love, approach to create, it is impossiblethat there should not be, above that ineffable kiss, a quiveringthroughout the immense mystery of stars.These felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of thesejoys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps.To love, or to have loved,--this suffices. Demand nothing more. Thereis no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is afulfilment.CHAPTER III--THE INSEPARABLEWhat had become of Jean Valjean?Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette's graceful command, whenno one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gainedthe antechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight monthsbefore, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringingback the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlandedwith foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on whichthey had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, whitestockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishesthat were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling,charged Basque to explain his absence, and went away.The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjeanstood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneaththose radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the banquetreached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather,the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, andthrough all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette's sweet andjoyous voice.He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue del'Homme Arme.In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the RueCulture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a littlelonger, but it was the road through which, for the last three months,he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue del'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid theobstructions and the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple.This road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for him allpossibility of any other itinerary.Jean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mountedthe stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there.Jean Valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All thecupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette's bedroom. There were nosheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a caseor lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress,whose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again.All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had beencarried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the fourwalls. Toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner. One bed only wasmade up, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean Valjean'sbed.Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, andwent and came from one room to another.Then he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a table.He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand asthough it did not hurt him.He approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was itintentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had been jealous, onthe little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the Ruede l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a roundtable near the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort ofvivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before,Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the blackfichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which Cosette might almosthave worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, whichwas very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets,then the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved thegraceful form of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand.All this was black of hue. It was he who had brought those garments toMontfermeil for her. As he removed them from the valise, he laid them onthe bed. He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter,in a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, inrags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. He, JeanValjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in thesemourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, tosee her daughter wearing mourning for her, and, above all, to see thatshe was properly clothed, and that she was warm. He thought of thatforest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it together, Cosette and he;he thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless trees, of thewood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it mattered not, it wascharming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next tothe petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at them,one after the other. She was no taller than that, she had her big dollin her arms, she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron, shehad laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world buthim.Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical oldheart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette's garments,and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would haveheard frightful sobs.CHAPTER IV--THE IMMORTAL LIVER [68]The old and formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed somany phases, began once more.Jacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! how many times havewe beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the darkness,and struggling desperately against it!Unheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other momentsthe ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that conscience,mad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many times had thetruth set her knee inexorably upon his breast! How many times, hurledto earth by the light, had he begged for mercy! How many times hadthat implacable spark, lighted within him, and upon him by the Bishop,dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind! How many timeshad he risen to his feet in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaningagainst sophism, dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of hisconscience, again overthrown by it! How many times, after an equivoque,after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heardhis irritated conscience cry in his ear: "A trip! you wretch!" How manytimes had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat,under the evidence of duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. Whatsecret wounds which he alone felt bleed! What excoriations in hislamentable existence! How many times he had risen bleeding, bruised,broken, enlightened, despair in his heart, serenity in his soul!and, vanquished, he had felt himself the conqueror. And, after havingdislocated, broken, and rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it hadsaid to him, as it stood over him, formidable, luminous, and tranquil:"Now, go in peace!"But on emerging from so melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious peace,alas!Nevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing throughhis final combat.A heart-rending question presented itself.Predestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straightavenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassablealleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of manyways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous ofthese crossroads.He had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had thatgloomy intersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, as hadhappened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened outbefore him, the one tempting, the other alarming.Which was he to take?He was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious indexfinger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.Once more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and thesmiling ambush.Is it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing! anincurable destiny!This is the problem which presented itself to him:In what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happinessof Cosette and Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, it washe who had brought it about; he had, himself, buried it in his entrails,and at that moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to enjoy thesort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizinghis factory mark on a knife, on withdrawing it, all smoking, from hisown breast.Cosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, evenriches. And this was his doing.But what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, now thatit existed, now that it was there? Should he force himself on thishappiness? Should he treat it as belonging to him? No doubt, Cosette didbelong to another; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette allthat he could retain? Should he remain the sort of father, half seen butrespected, which he had hitherto been? Should he, without saying aword, bring his past to that future? Should he present himself there,as though he had a right, and should he seat himself, veiled, at thatluminous fireside? Should he take those innocent hands into his tragichands, with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of theGillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged behind themthe disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter into participation inthe fair fortunes of Cosette and Marius? Should he render the obscurityon his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense? Should heplace his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity? Should hecontinue to hold his peace? In a word, should he be the sinister mute ofdestiny beside these two happy beings?We must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it, inorder to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appearto us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands behindthis severe interrogation point. What are you going to do? demands thesphinx.This habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at thesphinx.He examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. Whatwas he to do? To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?If he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascendagain into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from hisgarments and his hair, he was saved, he should live.And if he let go his hold?Then the abyss.Thus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more correctly,he fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his will, nowagainst his conviction.Happily for Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. That relievedhim, possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furiousthan the one which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose withinhim. The past surged up before him facing the present; he comparedthem and sobbed. The silence of tears once opened, the despairing manwrithed.He felt that he had been stopped short.Alas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, whenwe thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, bewildered,furious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hopingfor a possible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt and sinisterresistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear!To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!The invisible inexorable, what an obsession!Then, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; makeyour choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings intothat well the labor of one's whole life, one flings in one's fortune,one flings in one's riches, one flings in one's success, one flings inone's liberty or fatherland, one flings in one's well-being, one flingsin one's repose, one flings in one's joy! More! more! more! Empty thevase! tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one's heart.Somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.Is not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustiblehave any right? Are not chains which are endless above human strength?Who would blame Sisyphus and Jean Valjean for saying: "It is enough!"The obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to theobedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can perpetualself-sacrifice be exacted?The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What wasthe Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage and ofthat which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, comparedto entrance into the void?Oh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! Oh, secondstep, how black art thou!How could he refrain from turning aside his head this time?Martyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture whichconsecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneselfon the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's head the crown of hotiron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre ofred hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, andcomes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when oneabdicates from suffering?At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysteriousbalance of light and darkness.Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or shouldhe consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side laythe sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.At what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?What resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive responseto the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide toopen? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which washis choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did henod his head?His dizzy revery lasted all night long.He remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double overthat bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed, perchance,alas! with clenched fists, with arms outspread at right angles, like aman crucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face down on the earth.There he remained for twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a longwinter's night, ice-cold, without once raising his head, and withoututtering a word. He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughtswallowed on the earth and soared, now like the hydra, now like theeagle. Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced himdead; all at once he shuddered convulsively, and his mouth, glued toCosette's garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he wasalive.Who could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one there.The One who is in the shadows.BOOK SEVENTH.--THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP[Illustration: Last Drop from the Cup  5b7-1-last-drop]CHAPTER I--THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVENThe days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect themeditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to somedegree. The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on.On the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past midday whenBasque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in settinghis antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had beenno ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, andbeheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the drawing-room, stillencumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battleafter the joys of the preceding evening."Dame, sir," remarked Basque, "we all woke up late.""Is your master up?" asked Jean Valjean."How is Monsieur's arm?" replied Basque."Better. Is your master up?""Which one? the old one or the new one?""Monsieur Pontmercy.""Monsieur le Baron," said Basque, drawing himself up.A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for somethingwith them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with thetitle, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militantrepublican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. Asmall revolution had taken place in the family in connection withthis title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius whodetached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: "My sonwill bear my title." Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the womanwas beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness."Monsieur le Baron?" repeated Basque. "I will go and see. I will tellhim that M. Fauchelevent is here.""No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes tospeak to him in private, and mention no name.""Ah!" ejaculated Basque."I wish to surprise him.""Ah!" ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second "ah!" as anexplanation of the first.And he left the room.Jean Valjean remained alone.The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It seemedas though, by lending an air, one might still hear the vague noise ofthe wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers whichhad fallen from garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burnedto stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of thechandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In thecorners, three or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle,had the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect wascheerful. A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast. It has beena happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers,beneath those extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sunhad succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into thedrawing-room.Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot whereBasque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and sosunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared intheir orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment thathas been up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which thefriction of cloth against linen leaves behind it.Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at hisfeet by the sun.There came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribablelight on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He hadnot slept either."It is you, father!" he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean;"that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come tooearly. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep."That word: "Father," said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified:supreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a loftywall, a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be brokenor melted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wallwas lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was tohim, as to Cosette, a father.He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divineparoxysms of joy."How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday!Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?"And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, hepursued:"We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! Youmust not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more todo with the Rue de l'Homme Arme. We will have no more of it at all. Howcould you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which isdisagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where oneis cold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and installyourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with Cosette.She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your ownchamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the troublewith the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready,you have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has placeda huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said toit: 'Stretch out your arms to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump ofacacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you willhave it. You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right. Bynight it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber facesdue South. Cosette will arrange your books for you, your Voyages ofCaptain Cook and the other,--Vancouver's and all your affairs. I believethat there is a little valise to which you are attached, I have fixedupon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather, yousuit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? you will overwhelmmy grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall takeCosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you shall give heryour arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutelyresolved to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our happiness,do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?""Sir," said Jean Valjean, "I have something to say to you. I am anex-convict."The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well inthe case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: "I am anex-convict," proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and enteringthe ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that somethinghad just been said to him; but he did not know what. He stood with hismouth wide open.Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful.Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment,observed the other man's terrible pallor.Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm,unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed itto Marius."There is nothing the matter with my hand," said he.Marius looked at the thumb."There has not been anything the matter with it," went on Jean Valjean.There was, in fact, no trace of any injury.Jean Valjean continued:"It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absentedmyself as much as was in my power. So I invented this injury in orderthat I might not commit a forgery, that I might not introduce a flawinto the marriage documents, in order that I might escape from signing."Marius stammered."What is the meaning of this?""The meaning of it is," replied Jean Valjean, "that I have been in thegalleys.""You are driving me mad!" exclaimed Marius in terror."Monsieur Pontmercy," said Jean Valjean, "I was nineteen years in thegalleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for asecond offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban."In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resistthe evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, asalways happens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward shudderof hideous enlightenment flashed through him; an idea which made himquiver traversed his mind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny forhimself in the future."Say all, say all!" he cried. "You are Cosette's father!"And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribablehorror.Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that heseemed to grow even to the ceiling."It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oathto others may not be received in law . . ."Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority,he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:". . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no.Monsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned myliving by pruning trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean.I am not related to Cosette. Reassure yourself."Marius stammered:"Who will prove that to me?""I. Since I tell you so."Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie couldproceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth couldbe felt in that chill of the tomb."I believe you," said Marius.Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, andcontinued:"What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know thatshe was in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom onehas seen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one feelsoneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it seems tome, suppose that I have something which resembles a heart. She was anorphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is why Ibegan to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a manlike me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towardsCosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can be called a goodaction; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have done it.Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes out of mylife; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She isMadame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by thechange. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do notmention them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit.How did that deposit come into my hands? What does that matter? Irestore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me. I completethe restitution by announcing my true name. That concerns me. I have areason for desiring that you should know who I am."And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain gustsof destiny produce these billows in our souls.We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within usis dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which arenot always precisely those which should be said. There are suddenrevelations which one cannot bear, and which intoxicate like balefulwine. Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itselfto him, to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who wasangry with him for this avowal."But why," he exclaimed, "do you tell me all this? Who forces you todo so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neitherdenounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonlymaking such a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In whatconnection do you make this confession? What is your motive?""My motive?" replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that onewould have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius."From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said 'I am a convict'?Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, theunfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps mefast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularlysolid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been ableto tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, togo far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there arediligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have triedto break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore myheart with it. Then I said: 'I cannot live anywhere else than here.' Imust stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simplyremain here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy issincerely attached to me, she said to the arm-chair: 'Stretch out yourarms to him,' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, Isuit him, we shall live together, and take our meals in common, I shallgive Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a habit, weshall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-cornerin winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness,that is everything. We shall live as one family. One family!"At that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared atthe floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abysstherein, and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:"As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours.I do not belong to any family of men. In houses where people are amongthemselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothingof the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did Ihave a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave thatchild in marriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and thatshe is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind oldman, a household of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that itwas well, I said to myself: 'Enter thou not.' I could have lied, it istrue, have deceived you all, and remained Monsieur Fauchelevent. So longas it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be for myself, and Imust not. It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, and allwould go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing;my conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed thenight in trying to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what Ihave just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to doit; well, yes, I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself,and I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what I could. But thereare two things in which I have not succeeded; in breaking the threadthat holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or insilencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. That is whyI have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything ornearly everything. It is useless to tell you that which concerns onlymyself; I keep that to myself. You know the essential points. So I havetaken my mystery and have brought it to you. And I have disembowelled mysecret before your eyes. It was not a resolution that was easy to take.I struggled all night long. Ah! you think that I did not tell myselfthat this was no Champmathieu affair, that by concealing my name I wasdoing no one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given tome by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for a service rendered tohim, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should be happy inthat chamber which you offer me, that I should not be in any one's way,that I should be in my own little corner, and that, while you would haveCosette, I should have the idea that I was in the same house with her.Each one of us would have had his share of happiness. If I continued tobe Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with theexception of my soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but thebottom of my soul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one mustbe content. Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thusI should have concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of yourexpansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your fullnoonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without crying ''ware,' Ishould have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I shouldhave taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew whoI was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself tobe served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: 'Howhorrible!' I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have aright to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! Therewould have existed in your house a division of respect between venerablewhite locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, whenall hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest,when we four were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, astranger would have been present! I should have been side by side withyou in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange thecover of my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myselfupon you who are living beings. I should have condemned her to myselfforever. You and Cosette and I would have had all three of our heads inthe green cap! Does it not make you shudder? I am only the most crushedof men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. And I should havecommitted that crime every day! And I should have had that face of nightupon my visage every day! every day! And I should have communicated toyou a share in my taint every day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved,my children, to you, my innocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one'speace? is it a simple matter to keep silence? No, it is not simple.There is a silence which lies. And my lie, and my fraud and myindignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I should havedrained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed itagain, I should have finished at midnight and have begun again atmidday, and my 'good morning' would have lied, and my 'good night' wouldhave lied, and I should have slept on it, I should have eaten it, withmy bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I shouldhave responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damnedsoul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why should I doit? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the right to behappy? I stand outside of life, Sir."Jean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and ofanguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice oncemore, but it was no longer a dull voice--it was a sinister voice."You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked,you say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself.It is I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I pushmyself, and I arrest myself, and I execute myself, and when one holdsoneself, one is firmly held."And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck andextending it towards Marius:"Do you see that fist?" he continued. "Don't you think that it holdsthat collar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! conscienceis another grasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must neverunderstand duty; for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it isimplacable. One would say that it punished you for comprehending it;but no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where you feel Godbeside you. One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is atpeace with himself."And, with a poignant accent, he added:"Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It isby degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. Thishas happened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it wasa mere nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should not be so if, through myfault, you had continued to esteem me; now that you despise me, I am so.I have that fatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever haveanything but stolen consideration, that consideration humiliates me,and crushes me inwardly, and, in order that I may respect myself, it isnecessary that I should be despised. Then I straighten up again. I ama galley-slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that that is mostimprobable. But what would you have me do about it? it is the fact.I have entered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There areencounters which bind us, there are chances which involve us in duties.You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me in thecourse of my life."Again Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, asthough his words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:"When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right tomake others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right tomake them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it,one has not the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them, one has noright to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others. It ishideous to approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in the darkwith one's ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent me hisname, I have no right to use it; he could give it to me, but I could nottake it. A name is an _I_. You see, sir, that I have thought somewhat, Ihave read a little, although I am a peasant; and you see that Iexpress myself properly. I understand things. I have procured myself aneducation. Well, yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself under itis dishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or awatch. To be a false signature in flesh and blood, to be a living falsekey, to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock, nevermore to look straightforward, to forever eye askance, to be infamouswithin the _I_, no! no! no! no! no! It is better to suffer, to bleed, toweep, to tear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails, to pass nightswrithing in anguish, to devour oneself body and soul. That is why I havejust told you all this. Wantonly, as you say."He drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:"In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, inorder to live, I will not steal a name.""To live!" interrupted Marius. "You do not need that name in order tolive?""Ah! I understand the matter," said Jean Valjean, raising and loweringhis head several times in succession.A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf ofthoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of hismouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean waspacing to and fro. He paused before a mirror, and remained motionless.Then, as though replying to some inward course of reasoning, he said, ashe gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:"While, at present, I am relieved."He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of thedrawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived thatMarius was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressibleintonation:"I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!"Then he turned fully round towards Marius:"And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remainedMonsieur Fauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one ofyou, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers,in the evening all three of us go to the play, I accompany MadamePontmercy to the Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are together,you think me your equal; one fine day you are there, and I am there, weare conversing, we are laughing; all at once, you hear a voice shoutingthis name: 'Jean Valjean!' and behold, that terrible hand, the police,darts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!"Again he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. JeanValjean resumed:"What do you say to that?"Marius' silence answered for him.Jean Valjean continued:"You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, bein heaven, be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be contenttherewith, and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poordamned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth;you have before you, sir, a wretched man."Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to JeanValjean, he offered the latter his hand.But Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was notoffered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Mariusthat he pressed a hand of marble."My grandfather has friends," said Marius; "I will procure your pardon.""It is useless," replied Jean Valjean. "I am believed to be dead, andthat suffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They aresupposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon."And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort ofinexorable dignity:"Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty;and I need but one pardon, that of my conscience."At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room openedgently half way, and in the opening Cosette's head appeared. They sawonly her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids werestill swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrustsits head out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at JeanValjean, and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to behold asmile at the heart of a rose:"I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, insteadof being with me!"Jean Valjean shuddered."Cosette! . . ." stammered Marius.And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There wassomething in her eyes like gleams of paradise."I have caught you in the very act," said Cosette. "Just now, I heard myfather Fauchelevent through the door saying: 'Conscience . . . doing myduty . . .' That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. Peopleshould not talk politics the very next day. It is not right.""You are mistaken. Cosette," said Marius, "we are talking business. Weare discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousandfrancs . . .""That is not it at all," interrupted Cosette. "I am coming. Does anybody want me here?"And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousandfolds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet.In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are thesecharming sacks fit to clothe the angels.She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, thenexclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy:"There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!"That said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean."There," said she, "I am going to install myself near you in aneasy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything youlike, I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good."Marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:"We are talking business.""By the way," said Cosette, "I have opened my window, a flock ofpierrots has arrived in the garden,--Birds, not maskers. To-day isAsh-Wednesday; but not for the birds.""I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leaveus alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.""You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are verydandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.""I assure you that it will bore you.""No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listento you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does notneed to understand the words that they utter. That we should be heretogether--that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!""You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible.""Impossible!""Yes.""Very good," said Cosette. "I was going to tell you some news. I couldhave told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt isat mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent's room smokes, thatNicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolettehave already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint'sstammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! it is impossible? you shallsee, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then whowill be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here withyou two.""I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone.""Well, am I anybody?"Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:"In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What doyou mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? who gave mesuch a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is veryunhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly."Jean Valjean approached.Cosette turned toward Marius."As for you, I shall make a face at you."Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.Jean Valjean advanced a step toward her.Cosette recoiled."Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?""It is well," said Jean Valjean."Did you sleep badly?""No.""Are you sad?""No.""Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, Iwill not scold you."And again she offered him her brow.Jean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestialgleam."Smile."Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre."Now, defend me against my husband.""Cosette! . . ." ejaculated Marius."Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk beforeme. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! business,placing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out ofnothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius."And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribablyexquisite pout, she glanced at Marius."I love you!" said Marius."I adore you!" said Cosette.And they fell irresistibly into each other's arms."Now," said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with atriumphant little grimace, "I shall stay.""No, not that," said Marius, in a supplicating tone. "We have to finishsomething.""Still no?"Marius assumed a grave tone:"I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.""Ah! you put on your man's voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father,have not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you aretyrants. I shall go and tell grandpapa. If you think that I am going toreturn and talk platitudes to you, you are mistaken. I am proud. I shallwait for you now. You shall see, that it is you who are going to bebored without me. I am going, it is well."And she left the room.Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy headwas again thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:"I am very angry indeed."The door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed thenight, without itself being conscious of it.Marius made sure that the door was securely closed."Poor Cosette!" he murmured, "when she finds out . . ."At that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius abewildered eye."Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this.That is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength forone thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir,give me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Isit not enough that you should know it? I have been able to say it myselfwithout being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to thewhole world,--it was all one to me. But she, she does not know whatit is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged toexplain matters to her, to say to her: 'He is a man who has been in thegalleys.' She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!" . . . Hedropped into an arm-chair and hid his face in his hands.His grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders itwas evident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears.There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sortof convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as thoughto gain breath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see hisface inundated with tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that hisvoice seemed to issue from fathomless depths:"Oh! would that I could die!""Be at your ease," said Marius, "I will keep your secret for myselfalone." And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, butforced, for the last hour, to familiarize himself with somethingas unexpected as it was dreadful, gradually beholding the convictsuperposed before his very eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, overcome,little by little, by that lugubrious reality, and led, by the naturalinclination of the situation, to recognize the space which had just beenplaced between that man and himself, Marius added:"It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard tothe deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That isan act of probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed onyou. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fearto set it very high.""I thank you, sir," replied Jean Valjean, gently.He remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of hisfore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:"All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .""What is it?"Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, withoutvoice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:"Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that Iought not to see Cosette any more?""I think that would be better," replied Marius coldly."I shall never see her more," murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed hissteps towards the door.He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. JeanValjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless fora second, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tearsin his eyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained astrange composure."Stay, sir," he said. "If you will allow it, I will come to see her. Iassure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette,I should not have made to you the confession that I have made, I shouldhave gone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosetteis, and to continue to see her, I had to tell you about it honestly. Youfollow my reasoning, do you not? it is a matter easily understood. Yousee, I have had her with me for more than nine years. We lived firstin that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near theLuxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first time. You rememberher blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, wherethere was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a littleback court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was my life. Wenever left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. Iwas like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whetheryou understand, Monsieur Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see heragain, never to speak to her again, to no longer have anything, wouldbe hard. If you do not disapprove of it, I will come to see Cosette fromtime to time. I will not come often. I will not remain long. You shallgive orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On theground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, but thatmight create surprise perhaps, and it would be better, I think, for meto enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should like to see a littlemore of Cosette. As rarely as you please. Put yourself in my place,I have nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious. If Ino longer come at all, it would produce a bad effect, it would beconsidered singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in theafternoon, when night is beginning to fall.""You shall come every evening," said Marius, "and Cosette will bewaiting for you.""You are kind, sir," said Jean Valjean.Marius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, andthese two men parted.CHAPTER II--THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAINMarius was quite upset.The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man besidewhom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was somethingenigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned him.This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M.Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness resemblesthe discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such aneighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of thatman form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to bedone?Had Marius wedded the convict as well?In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste thegrand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even thearchangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius askedhimself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had hebeen wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had heinvoluntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered uponthis love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, withouttaking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? Headmitted,--it is thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselvesin regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little by little,--headmitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort ofinternal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysmsof passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes,and invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothingmore than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than onceindicated this characteristic element of Marius' individuality.He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet,during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoke toCosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had takenup such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuingflight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette?Yet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he hadnot even named the Thenardiers, and, particularly, on the day when hehad encountered Eponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain hissilence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalledhis benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbingeverything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhapsalso, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with thisviolent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impellinghim to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure,contact with which he dreaded, in which he did not wish to play anypart, his agency in which he had kept secret, and in which he could beneither narrator nor witness without being an accuser.Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had beenno time for anything except love.In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind,examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he hadtold Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered thatJean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Wouldthat have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would he haveadored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No.Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproachhimself. All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who arecalled lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would havechosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandagedhis eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernalaccompaniment.Marius' ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Faucheleventwho had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror.In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certainsurprise.This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored thatdeposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all,he had restored it all.Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him tothis. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In thisavowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, therewas acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, itis a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that falsename. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in anhonest family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive?Through a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this with theirresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this Jean Valjeanmight be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. Thereexisted some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to allappearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man.Such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgarnatures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.Jean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable,irrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, renderedinquiries useless, and conferred authority on all that that man hadsaid.Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. Whatbreathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire?confidence.In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Mariusstruck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passiveprinciple, and he tried to reach a balance.But all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form aclear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, inthe depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession--these weregood. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud becameblack once more.Troubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned to him.After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had thatman taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering acomplaint?Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive fromjustice, who had broken his ban.Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade?For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which hadre-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application ofheat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. Whathad he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre sprangup and replied: "Javert."Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjeandragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heardbehind the corner of the little Rue Mondetour that frightful pistolshot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and thegalley-slave. The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean had gone tothe barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived late.He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican vendettahas penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there; itis so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turnedtowards good; and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal, whois in the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theftand unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killedJavert. At least, that seemed to be evident.This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply.This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass thatJean Valjean's existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long aperiod?What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that childin contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forgedon high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with thedemon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysteriousgalleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons whichis called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, the oneingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the divinewhiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of aneternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairingoff? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any communityof life been established between this celestial little creature and thatold criminal?Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still moreincomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf lovedthe lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, duringthe space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point ofsupport. Cosette's childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight,her virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered bythat hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, intoinnumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, andMarius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy.What was this man-precipice?The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it nowexists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there willalways be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the onewhich is according to good is Abel; the other which is according to evilis Cain. What was this tender Cain? What was this ruffian religiouslyabsorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her,guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he washimself, with purity?What was that cess-pool which had venerated that innocence to such apoint as not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjeaneducating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for itsonly object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadowand from every cloud?That was Jean Valjean's secret; that was also God's secret.In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in somesort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affairas was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the toolwhich he wills. He is not responsible to men. Do we know how God setsabout the work? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had, to someextent, made that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? Theworkman was horrible; but the work was admirable. God produces hismiracles as seems good to him. He had constructed that charming Cosette,and he had employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him to choose thisstrange collaborator for himself. What account have we to demand of him?Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to createthe rose?Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that theywere good. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the pointswhich we have just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that hedid not dare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosettewas splendidly pure. That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment didhe need? Cosette was a light. Does light require enlightenment? He hadeverything; what more could he desire? All,--is not that enough? JeanValjean's personal affairs did not concern him.And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast,convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: "Iam nothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was inexistence."Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he hadpassed. Whatever he was, his part was finished.Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence toCosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in herlover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her flight,winged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous andempty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to acertain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as wehave just pointed out, he felt a quid divinum in that man. But do whathe would, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced tofall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being whohas not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than thevery lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. Theconvict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. Thelaw has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it candeprive a man.Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, thoughhe was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on thesubject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished allprogress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between thatwhich is written by man and that which is written by God, between lawand right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes todispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked bythe word vindicte. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of thewritten law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted,as the process of civilization, social damnation. He still stood at thispoint, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since his nature wasgood, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress.In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous andrepulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word wasfor him like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, afterhaving reflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final gesturehad been to turn away his head. Vade retro.Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, whileinterrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said:"You are confessing me," had not, nevertheless, put to him two or threedecisive questions.It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but thathe had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert?Who knows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean didnot seem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius,after having urged him on, would not have himself desired to hold himback?Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, tostop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we haveasked a question? It is especially when one loves that one gives wayto these exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinistersituations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side ofour life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light mighthave proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and whoknows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as faras Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not havelingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of alightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncturewhere innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of thereflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preservethe reflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Mariushad been afraid. He already knew too much. He sought to dull his sensesrather than to gain further light.In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to JeanValjean.That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should hedare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogatethe shadow. Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackenedforever by it.In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, comeinto any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity toMarius.He now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidablequestions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacableand definitive decision might have sprung. He felt that he was too good,too gentle, too weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had led himto an imprudent concession. He had allowed himself to be touched. Hehad been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely rejectedJean Valjean. Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that is what heshould have done, and have freed his house from that man.He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotionswhich had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeasedwith himself.What was he to do now? Jean Valjean's visits were profoundly repugnantto him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did theman want? Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he didnot wish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. Hehad promised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; JeanValjean held his promise; one must keep one's word even to a convict,above all to a convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short,he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him.Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passingfrom one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profoundtrouble.It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is atalent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was ascandid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of herchildhood and her youth, and he became more and more convinced that thatconvict had been everything good, paternal and respectable that a mancan be towards Cosette. All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and hadsurmised was real. That sinister nettle had loved and protected thatlily.BOOK EIGHTH.--FADING AWAY OF THE TWILIGHT[Illustration: The Twilight Decline  5b8-1-decline]CHAPTER I--THE LOWER CHAMBEROn the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriagegate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basquewas in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had receivedhis orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: "You willwatch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives."Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approachhim:"Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires togo upstairs or to remain below?""I will remain below," replied Jean Valjean.Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of thewaiting-room and said:"I will go and inform Madame."The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on theground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on thestreet, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a gratedwindow.This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by thefeather-duster, the pope's head brush, and the broom. The dust restedtranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. Afine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamentedwith dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room,which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of emptybottles piled up in one corner.The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off inlarge flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in blackwith a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that JeanValjean's reply: "I will remain below," had been foreseen.Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Betweenthe chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation threadthan wool, had been spread by way of a carpet.The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilightfalling through the window.Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. Hethrew himself into one of the arm-chairs.Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired.Jean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast,perceived neither Basque nor the candle.All at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standingbeside him.He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.He turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what hewas contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but hersoul."Well," exclaimed Cosette, "father, I knew that you were peculiar, butI never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that youwish me to receive you here.""Yes, it is my wish.""I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scenefor you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father."And she offered him her cheek.Jean Valjean remained motionless."You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind,I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is."And she presented her other cheek.Jean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed tothe pavement."This is becoming serious," said Cosette. "What have I done to you? Ideclare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine withus.""I have dined.""That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathersare made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to thedrawing-room. Immediately.""Impossible."Here Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed toquestioning."But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which tosee me. It's horrible here.""Thou knowest . . ."Jean Valjean caught himself up."You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks."Cosette struck her tiny hands together."Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning ofthis?"Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which heoccasionally had recourse:"You wished to be Madame. You are so.""Not for you, father.""Do not call me father.""What?""Call me 'Monsieur Jean.' 'Jean,' if you like.""You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? 'Monsieur Jean'?What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren't they? what hastaken place? come, look me in the face. And you won't live with us!And you won't have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anythinghappened?""Nothing.""Well then?""Everything is as usual.""Why do you change your name?""You have changed yours, surely."He smiled again with the same smile as before and added:"Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.""I don't understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall askpermission of my husband for you to be 'Monsieur Jean.' I hope that hewill not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One doeshave freaks, but one does not cause one's little Cosette grief. That iswrong. You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good."He made no reply.She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face withan irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath herchin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness."Oh!" she said to him, "be good!"And she went on:"This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and livinghere,--there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living withus, quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme, not giving us riddlesto guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us,breakfasting with us, being my father."He loosed her hands."You no longer need a father, you have a husband."Cosette became angry."I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say tothings like that, which are not common sense!""If Toussaint were here," resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who isdriven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, "she wouldbe the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of myown. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner.""But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, thatit is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say 'you' to me."Just now, as I was coming hither," replied Jean Valjean, "I saw a pieceof furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker's. If Iwere a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of furniture. Avery neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, Ithink. It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It ispretty.""Hou! the villainous bear!" replied Cosette.And with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips, sheblew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat."I am furious," she resumed. "Ever since yesterday, you have made merage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don't understand. You do notdefend me against Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I amall alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the goodGod there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. Mylodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner ofNicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And myfather Fauchelevent wants me to call him 'Monsieur Jean,' and to receivehim in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, andwhere the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the curtains are ofspiders' webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your style, but peoplewho get married are granted a truce. You ought not to have begun beingsingular again instantly. So you are going to be perfectly contented inyour abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme. I was very desperate indeed there,that I was. What have you against me? You cause me a great deal ofgrief. Fi!"And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean andadded:"Are you angry with me because I am happy?"Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question,which was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette hadmeant to scratch, and she lacerated.Jean Valjean turned pale.He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressibleintonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:"Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal.Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.""Ah, you have said thou to me!" exclaimed Cosette.And she sprang to his neck.Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. Italmost seemed to him as though he were taking her back."Thanks, father!" said Cosette.This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for JeanValjean. He gently removed Cosette's arms, and took his hat."Well?" said Cosette."I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you."And, from the threshold, he added:"I have said thou to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happenagain. Pardon me."Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at thisenigmatical farewell.CHAPTER II--ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDSOn the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longerexclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, sheavoided saying either "father" or "Monsieur Jean." She allowed herselfto be addressed as you. She allowed herself to be called Madame. Only,her joy had undergone a certain diminution. She would have been sad, ifsadness had been possible to her.It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversationsin which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, andsatisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extendvery far beyond their own love.The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed thebottles, and Nicolette the spiders.All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. Hecame every day, because he had not the strength to take Marius' wordsotherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent atthe hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the novelways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction: "Monsieurhas always been like that," she repeated. The grandfather issued thisdecree:--"He's an original." And all was said. Moreover, at the age ofninety-six, no bond is any longer possible, all is merely juxtaposition;a newcomer is in the way. There is no longer any room; all habits areacquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormandasked nothing better than to be relieved from "that gentleman." Headded:--"Nothing is more common than those originals. They do all sortsof queer things. They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was stillworse. He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These arefantastic appearances that people affect."No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, whocould have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this descriptionin India. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling thoughthere is no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at thesurface of these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the hydrawhich crawls on the bottom.Many men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which gnawsthem, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resemblesother men, he goes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him afrightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within theunhappy man, and of which he is dying. No one knows that this man is agulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of whichthe onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface. A mysteriouswrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then re-appears; an air-bubble risesand bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people aretaking their leave, keeping in the background when other peopleare displaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may bedesignated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk,preferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation,avoiding crowds and festivals, seeming at one's ease and living poorly,having one's key in one's pocket, and one's candle at the porter'slodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, ascendingthe private staircase,--all these insignificant singularities, fugitivefolds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation.Many weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possessionof Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the careof the house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette's pleasures were notcostly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The greatoccupation of her life was to go out with him, to remain with him. Itwas for them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in theface of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, beforethe whole world, both of them completely alone.Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, thesoldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away.The grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; AuntGillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her,beside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.The address as thou disappeared, the you, the "Madame," the "MonsieurJean," rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he hadhimself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more andmore gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely,and he felt it.One day she said to him suddenly: "You used to be my father, you areno longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, youwere Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don'tlike all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid ofyou."He still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, because he could not make uphis mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.At first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then wentaway.Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief.One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization ofthe days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed later.One day Cosette chanced to say "father" to him. A flash of joyilluminated Jean Valjean's melancholy old countenance. He caught herup: "Say Jean."--"Ah! truly," she replied with a burst of laughter,"Monsieur Jean."--"That is right," said he. And he turned aside so thatshe might not see him wipe his eyes.CHAPTER III--THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMETThis was the last time. After that last flash of light, completeextinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with akiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet: "My father!" He was athis own request and through his own complicity driven out of all hishappinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that afterhaving lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to loseher again in detail.The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. Inshort, it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day.His whole life was concentrated in that one hour.He seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, or he talkedto her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of her littlefriends of those bygone days.One afternoon,--it was on one of those early days in April, alreadywarm and fresh, the moment of the sun's great gayety, the gardens whichsurrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking,the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture ofgillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned throughthe crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charmingbeginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of theyear were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of theeternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand,auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,--Marius saidto Cosette:--"We said that we would go back to take a look at our gardenin the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful."--Andaway they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden ofthe Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They alreadyhad behind them in life something which was like the springtime of theirlove. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still belongedto Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There theyfound themselves again, there they forgot themselves. Thatevening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire.--"Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yetreturned," Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waitedan hour. Cosette did not return. He departed with drooping head.Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to "their garden," and sojoyous at having "lived a whole day in her past," that she talked ofnothing else on the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seenJean Valjean."In what way did you go thither?" Jean Valjean asked her.""On foot.""And how did you return?""In a hackney carriage."For some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by theyoung people. He was troubled by it. Marius' economy was severe, andthat word had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean. He hazarded aquery:"Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupe would onlycost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich.""I don't know," replied Cosette."It is like Toussaint," resumed Jean Valjean. "She is gone. You have notreplaced her. Why?""Nicolette suffices.""But you ought to have a maid.""Have I not Marius?""You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, abox at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit byyour riches? Wealth adds to happiness."Cosette made no reply.Jean Valjean's visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is theheart which is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope.When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induceforgetfulness of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronouncedhim handsome, noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdidhim. Jean Valjean began again. They were never weary. Marius--that wordwas inexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. In this manner,Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time.It was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated hiswounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce:"M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner isserved."On those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home.Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis whichhad presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really achrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?One day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day heobserved that there was no fire on the hearth.--"Hello!" he thought. "Nofire."--And he furnished the explanation for himself.--"It is perfectlysimple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased.""Heavens! how cold it is here!" exclaimed Cosette when she entered."Why, no," said Jean Valjean."Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?""Yes, since we are now in the month of May.""But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in thiscellar.""I thought that a fire was unnecessary.""That is exactly like one of your ideas!" retorted Cosette.On the following day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs werearranged at the other end of the room near the door. "--What is themeaning of this?" thought Jean Valjean.He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary placenear the hearth.This fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged theconversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose to take hisleave, Cosette said to him:"My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday.""What was it?""He said to me: 'Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres.Twenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.' Ireplied: 'That makes thirty.' He went on: 'Would you have the courage tolive on the three thousand?' I answered: 'Yes, on nothing. Providedthat it was with you.' And then I asked: 'Why do you say that to me?' Hereplied: 'I wanted to know.'"Jean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected someexplanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to theRue de l'Homme Arme; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook thedoor and instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoiningdwelling. It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that heperceived his error and went down again.His mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius hadhis doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, thathe feared some source that was not pure, who knows? that he had even,perhaps, discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that hehesitated before this suspicious fortune, and was disinclined to takeit as his own,--preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor,rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.Moreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shownthe door.On the following day, he underwent something like a shock on enteringthe ground-floor room. The arm-chairs had disappeared. There was not asingle chair of any sort."Ah, what's this!" exclaimed Cosette as she entered, "no chairs! Whereare the arm-chairs?""They are no longer here," replied Jean Valjean."This is too much!"Jean Valjean stammered:"It was I who told Basque to remove them.""And your reason?""I have only a few minutes to stay to-day.""A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing.""I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.""Why?""You have company this evening, no doubt.""We expect no one."Jean Valjean had not another word to say.Cosette shrugged her shoulders."To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out.How odd you are!""Adieu!" murmured Jean Valjean.He did not say: "Adieu, Cosette." But he had not the strength to say:"Adieu, Madame."He went away utterly overwhelmed.This time he had understood.On the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact inthe evening."Why," said she, "Monsieur Jean has not been here today."And she felt a slight twinge at her heart, but she hardly perceived it,being immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius.On the following day he did not come.Cosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening and slept well thatnight, as usual, and thought of it only when she woke. She was so happy!She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean's house to inquire whetherhe were ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening. Nicolettebrought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was busy. Hewould come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the pointof taking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his customto take trips from time to time. They were not to worry about him. Theywere not to think of him.Nicolette on entering M. Jean's had repeated to him her mistress' verywords. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean bad not come onthe preceding evening."--It is two days since I have been there," saidJean Valjean gently.But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it toCosette.CHAPTER IV--ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTIONDuring the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833,the rare passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers onthresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, who emerged everyday at the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de l'Homme Arme,on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in frontof the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and,on arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, and entered theRue Saint-Louis.There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeingnothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point whichseemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and which was noother than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer heapproached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sortof joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a fascinatedand much affected air, his lips indulged in obscure movements, as thoughhe were talking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled vaguely andadvanced as slowly as possible. One would have said that, while desirousof reaching his destination, he feared the moment when he should beclose at hand. When only a few houses remained between him and thatstreet which appeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such adegree that, at times, one might have thought that he was no longeradvancing at all. The vacillation of his head and the fixity of hiseyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole.Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to arrive at last; hereached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he trembled, hethrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner ofthe last house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragiclook something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible,and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him. Then a tear,which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids, and had becomelarge enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, and sometimes stopped athis mouth. The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thus he remained forseveral minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the sameroad and with the same step, and, in proportion as he retreated, hisglance died out.Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of theRue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis;sometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer.One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine andlooked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then heshook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing himselfsomething, and retraced his steps.Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far asthe Rue Pavee, shook his head and turned back; then he went nofurther than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep theBlancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum which wasno longer wound up, and whose oscillations were growing shorter beforeceasing altogether.Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook thesame trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps withouthimself being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His wholecountenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?--His eye wasdim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longercollected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. Theold man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times; thefolds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when theweather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, but he never openedit.The good women of the quarter said: "He is an innocent." The childrenfollowed him and laughed.BOOK NINTH.--SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME DAWNCHAPTER I--PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPYIt is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! Howall-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the falseobject of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty!Let us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blameMarius.Marius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questionsto M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any toJean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowedhimself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had donewrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself togradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him,as much as possible, from Cosette's mind. He had, in a manner, alwaysplaced himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in thisway, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more thaneffacement, it was an eclipse.Marius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he hadserious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which willbe seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness, butwithout weakness.Chance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he hadargued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquiredmysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not beenable, it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he hadpromised to guard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean's perilousposition. He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty toperform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to someone whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, heabstained from touching that money.As for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets;but it would be harsh to condemn her also.There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, whichcaused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Mariuswished. She was conscious of Marius' will in the direction of "MonsieurJean," she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to sayanything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of histacit intentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instanceconsisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged tomake any effort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself, andwithout his having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had becomeso wholly her husband's that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius'mind became overcast in hers.Let us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, thisforgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was ratherheedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to theman whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husbandstill more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance ofher heart, which leaned to one side only.It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressedher surprise. Then Marius calmed her: "He is absent, I think. Did nothe say that he was setting out on a journey?"--"That is true," thoughtCosette. "He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for solong." Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in theRue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. JeanValjean caused the answer "no" to be given.Cosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth, Marius.Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had alsobeen absent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to hisfather's grave.Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it.Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, theingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproachas it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we haveelsewhere said, "looks before her." Nature divides living beings intothose who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who aredeparting are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towardsthe light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, andinvoluntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible,increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, withoutbecoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault oftheirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love.Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, butthere is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the coolingoff of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poorchildren.CHAPTER II--LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OILOne day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in thestreet, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where Gavrochehad found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th ofJune; he remained there a few moments, then went up stairs again. Thiswas the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he didnot leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave hisbed.His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages orpotatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate andexclaimed:"But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!""Certainly I did," replied Jean Valjean."The plate is quite full.""Look at the water jug. It is empty.""That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you haveeaten.""Well," said Jean Valjean, "what if I felt hungry only for water?""That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, itis called fever.""I will eat to-morrow.""Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: 'I will eatto-morrow'? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! Myladyfinger potatoes were so good!"Jean Valjean took the old woman's hand:"I promise you that I will eat them," he said, in his benevolent voice."I am not pleased with you," replied the portress.Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There arestreets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to whichno one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of thosehouses.While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a fewsous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail oppositehis bed. That gibbet is always good to look at.A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. Hestill remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:--"The good manupstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not lastlong. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won't get it out of myhead that his daughter has made a bad marriage."The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:"If he's rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him gowithout. If he has no doctor he will die.""And if he has one?""He will die," said the porter.The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called herpavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, shegrumbled:"It's a shame. Such a neat old man! He's as white as a chicken."She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end ofthe street; she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs."It's on the second floor," said she. "You have only to enter. As thegood man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked."The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him.When he came down again the portress interrogated him:"Well, doctor?""Your sick man is very ill indeed.""What is the matter with him?""Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lostsome person who is dear to him. People die of that.""What did he say to you?""He told me that he was in good health.""Shall you come again, doctor?""Yes," replied the doctor. "But some one else besides must come."CHAPTER III--A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT'SCARTOne evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on hiselbow; he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse; his breathwas short and halted at times; he recognized the fact that he was weakerthan he had ever been before. Then, no doubt under the pressure of somesupreme preoccupation, he made an effort, drew himself up into a sittingposture and dressed himself. He put on his old workingman's clothes. Ashe no longer went out, he had returned to them and preferred them. Hewas obliged to pause many times while dressing himself; merely puttinghis arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from hisforehead.Since he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, inorder to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible.He opened the valise and drew from it Cosette's outfit.He spread it out on his bed.The Bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. Hetook from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks.Then, although it was still broad daylight,--it was summer,--he lightedthem. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylightin chambers where there is a corpse.Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to anotherexhausted him, and he was obliged to sit down. It was not ordinaryfatigue which expends the strength only to renew it; it was the remnantof all movement possible to him, it was life drained which flows awaydrop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed.The chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front ofthat mirror, so fatal for him, so providential for Marius, in whichhe had read Cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book. He caughtsight of himself in this mirror, and did not recognize himself. He waseighty years old; before Marius' marriage, he would have hardly beentaken for fifty; that year had counted for thirty. What he bore on hisbrow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark ofdeath. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there. Hischeeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color which wouldlead one to think that it already had earth upon it; the corners of hismouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs. Hegazed into space with an air of reproach; one would have said that hewas one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of someone.He was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrowno longer flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something onthe soul like a clot of despair.Night had come. He laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair tothe fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper.That done, he had a fainting fit. When he recovered consciousness, hewas thirsty. As he could not lift the jug, he tipped it over painfullytowards his mouth, and swallowed a draught.As neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time, the pointof the pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was forced to riseand put a few drops of water in the ink, which he did not accomplishwithout pausing and sitting down two or three times, and he wascompelled to write with the back of the pen. He wiped his brow from timeto time.Then he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could notstand, he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.These contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes.All at once he shivered, he felt that a child was taking possession ofhim; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated by theBishop's candles and took up the pen. His hand trembled. He wrote slowlythe few following lines:"Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband wasright in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; but there isa little error in what he believed, though he was in the right. He isexcellent. Love him well even after I am dead. Monsieur Pontmercy, lovemy darling child well. Cosette, this paper will be found; this is whatI wish to say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the strengthto recall them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here is thewhole matter: White jet comes from Norway, black jet comes from England,black glass jewellery comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest, the mostprecious, the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as well asin Germany. What is needed is a little anvil two inches square, and alamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerlymade with resin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound. Iinvented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine. It does notcost more than thirty sous, and is much better. Buckles are made witha violet glass which is stuck fast, by means of this wax, to a littleframework of black iron. The glass must be violet for iron jewellery,and black for gold jewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it. It is thecountry of jet . . ."Here he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one ofthose sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being;the poor man clasped his head in both hands, and meditated."Oh!" he exclaimed within himself [lamentable cries, heard by Godalone], "all is over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile whichpassed over me. I am about to plunge into the night without even seeingher again. Oh! one minute, one instant, to hear her voice, to touch herdress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! and then to die! It isnothing to die, what is frightful is to die without seeing her. Shewould smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm toany one? No, all is over, and forever. Here I am all alone. My God! MyGod! I shall never see her again!" At that moment there came a knock atthe door.CHAPTER IV--A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENINGThat same day, or to speak more accurately, that same evening, as Mariusleft the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his study, havinga case to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying: "The person whowrote the letter is in the antechamber."Cosette had taken the grandfather's arm and was strolling in the garden.A letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. Coarsepaper, coarsely folded--the very sight of certain missives isdispleasing.The letter which Basque had brought was of this sort.Marius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory like anodor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription:"To Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. At his hotel." The recognitionof the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well. It may besaid that amazement has its lightning flashes.Marius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.The sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just revived awhole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashionof folding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-knownhandwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.The Jondrette garret rose before his mind.Thus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had sodiligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately againexerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost, hadcome and presented itself to him of its own accord.He eagerly broke the seal, and read: "Monsieur le Baron:--If the Supreme Being had given me the talents, I might have been baron Thenard, member of the Institute [academy of ciences], but I am not.  I only bear the same as him, happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses. The benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle. I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual. This individual concerns you.  I hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you.  I will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there, madame la baronne being of lofty birth.  The sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating. "I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron.                                               "With respect."The letter was signed "Thenard."This signature was not false. It was merely a trifle abridged.Moreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation.The certificate of origin was complete.Marius' emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, he underwent afeeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom hewas in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothingleft for him to desire.He opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes,put them in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell.Basque half opened the door."Show the man in," said Marius.Basque announced:"Monsieur Thenard."A man entered.A fresh surprise for Marius. The man who entered was an utter strangerto him.This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in acravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over hiseyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow ona level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in "highlife." His hair was gray. He was dressed in black from head to foot, ingarments that were very threadbare but clean; a bunch of seals dependingfrom his fob suggested the idea of a watch. He held in his hand an oldhat! He walked in a bent attitude, and the curve in his spine augmentedthe profundity of his bow.The first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage'scoat, which was too ample although carefully buttoned, had not been madefor him.Here a short digression becomes necessary.There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the RueBeautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession wasto change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might haveproved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a dayor two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume whichresembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible.This costumer was called "the Changer"; the pickpockets of Parishad given him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerablycomplete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people were almostprobable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of hisshop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of amagistrate, there the outfit of a Cure, beyond the outfit of a banker,in one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewherethe habiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of astatesman.This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery playsin Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and intowhich roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room,deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part whichhe wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending thestairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, theclothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted thethieves with everything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenienceabout these clothes, they "did not fit"; not having been made for thosewho wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another anddid not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded orfell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer'scostumes. It was necessary that one should not be either too fat ortoo lean. The changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken themeasure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who isneither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations whichwere sometimes difficult and from which the Changer's clients extricatedthemselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions!The suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, andconsequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too smallfor Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman was designated as followsin the Changer's catalogue; we copy:"A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, bootsand linen." On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a notewhich we also copy: "In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, greenglasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton."All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This wholecostume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams werewhite, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one ofthe coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; asthe hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laidupon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button.If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, hewould instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whomBasque had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from thepick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.Marius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom heexpected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage.He surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made exaggeratedbows, and demanded in a curt tone:"What do you want?"The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of acrocodile will furnish some idea:"It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honorof seeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I actually did meetmonsieur personally, several years ago, at the house of Madame laPrincesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the VicomteDambray, peer of France."It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognizesome one whom one does not know.Marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech. He spiedon his accent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; thepronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone whichhe had expected.He was utterly routed."I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray," said he. "I have neverset foot in the house of either of them in my life."The reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious atany cost, insisted."Then it must have been at Chateaubriand's that I have seen Monsieur! Iknow Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes says tome: 'Thenard, my friend . . . won't you drink a glass of wine with me?'"Marius' brow grew more and more severe:"I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand.Let us cut it short. What do you want?"The man bowed lower at that harsh voice."Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, in adistrict near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village is composedof a single house, a large, square house of three stories, built ofbricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred feet inlength, each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below, insuch a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuitof the edifice, in the centre an inner court where the provisions andmunitions are kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors, ladders, laddersto mount from the ground to the first terrace, and from the first to thesecond, and from the second to the third, ladders to descend into theinner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors, no staircases to thechambers, ladders; in the evening the traps are closed, the laddersare withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes;no means of entering, a house by day, a citadel by night, eight hundredinhabitants,--that is the village. Why so many precautions? because thecountry is dangerous; it is full of cannibals. Then why do people gothere? because the country is marvellous; gold is found there.""What are you driving at?" interrupted Marius, who had passed fromdisappointment to impatience."At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancientcivilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages.""Well?""Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarianpeasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligencepasses by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does notturn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dogof the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself.Self-interest--that's the object of men. Gold, that's the loadstone.""What then? Finish.""I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya. There are threeof us. I have my spouse and my young lady; a very beautiful girl. Thejourney is long and costly. I need a little money.""What concern is that of mine?" demanded Marius.The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesturecharacteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile."Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?"There was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of theepistle had slipped Marius' mind. He had seen the writing rather thanread the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a freshstart had been given him. He had noted that detail: "my spouse and myyoung lady."He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge couldnot have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him.He confined himself to replying:"State the case precisely."The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself upwithout straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in histurn, with the green gaze of his spectacles."So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret to sellto you.""A secret?""A secret.""Which concerns me?""Somewhat.""What is the secret?"Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him."I commence gratis," said the stranger. "You will see that I aminteresting.""Speak.""Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief and an assassin."Marius shuddered."In my house? no," said he.The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on:"An assassin and a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do not herespeak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which canbe effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God.I speak of recent deeds, of actual facts as still unknown to justiceat this hour. I continue. This man has insinuated himself into yourconfidence, and almost into your family under a false name. I am aboutto tell you his real name. And to tell it to you for nothing.""I am listening.""His name is Jean Valjean.""I know it.""I am going to tell you, equally for nothing, who he is.""Say on.""He is an ex-convict.""I know it.""You know it since I have had the honor of telling you.""No. I knew it before."Marius' cold tone, that double reply of "I know it," his laconicism,which was not favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering wrathin the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius,which was instantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, this glance was ofthe kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did notescape Marius. Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls;the eye, that vent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hidenothing; try putting a pane of glass over hell!The stranger resumed with a smile:"I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case,you ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have to tellyou is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame laBaronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale--I make you thefirst offer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs.""I know that secret as well as the others," said Marius.The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle."Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs and I will speak.""I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I knowwhat you wish to say to me."A fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye. He exclaimed:"But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret,I tell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me twentyfrancs."Marius gazed intently at him:"I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean's name,just as I know your name.""My name?""Yes.""That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write toyou and to tell it to you. Thenard.""--Dier.""Hey?""Thenardier.""Who's that?"In danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the oldguard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter.Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with afillip.Marius continued:"You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot thepoet, Don Alvares the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard.""Mistress what?""And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil.""A pot-house! Never.""And I tell you that your name is Thenardier.""I deny it.""And that you are a rascal. Here."And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face."Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!"And the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it."Five hundred francs!" he began again, taken aback. And he stammered ina low voice: "An honest rustler."[69]Then brusquely:"Well, so be it!" he exclaimed. "Let us put ourselves at our ease."And with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing offhis spectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the twoquills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has alsomet with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the mantakes off his hat.His eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places andbumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nosehad become as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of theman of prey reappeared."Monsieur le Baron is infallible," he said in a clear voice whence allnasal twang had disappeared, "I am Thenardier."And he straightened up his crooked back.Thenardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would havebeen troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to bringastonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation hadbeen worth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all, heaccepted it; but he was none the less bewildered.He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite ofhis disguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognizedhim thoroughly. And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as toThenardier, but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was thisalmost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knewpeople's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse tothem, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?Thenardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius'neighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he hadformerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor youngman named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, withoutknowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possiblein his mind.As for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefieldof Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which healways entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merelyan expression of thanks.However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent ofthe married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personalresearches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from thedepths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than onemysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least,by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he hadencountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he hadeasily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy wasCosette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter.Who was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catchan inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed tohim equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order tocause himself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had,better wares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, ifhe were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation--andwithout proof: "Your wife is a bastard," the only result would be toattract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.From Thenardier's point of view, the conversation with Marius had notyet begun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy,to have abandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothingessential had been compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francsin his pocket. Moreover, he had something decisive to say, and, evenagainst this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felthimself strong. For men of Thenardier's nature, every dialogue isa combat. In the one in which he was about to engage, what was hissituation? He did not know to whom he was speaking, but he did know ofwhat he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces, andafter having said: "I am Thenardier," he waited.Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thenardier at last.That man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He couldhonor Colonel Pontmercy's recommendation.He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to thisvillain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tombby his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. Italso seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thenardier,that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune ofhaving been saved by such a rascal. In any case, he was content. Hewas about to deliver the Colonel's shade from this unworthy creditorat last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing hisfather's memory from the debtors' prison. By the side of this duty therewas another--to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette's fortune.The opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps Thenardier knewsomething. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man.He commenced with this.Thenardier had caused the "honest rustler" to disappear in his fob, andwas gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender.Marius broke the silence."Thenardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have metell you your secret--the one that you came here to reveal to me? I haveinformation of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about itthan you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a thief.A thief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, whose ruin he broughtabout. An assassin, because he assassinated police-agent Javert.""I don't understand, sir," ejaculated Thenardier."I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pasde Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice,and who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status andrehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full forceof the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, hemade the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune wasconcerned he made that also, but as a secondary matter, and in somesort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the poor. He foundedhospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls,supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel ofthe country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberatedconvict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in formerdays; he denounced him, and had him arrested, and profited by the arrestto come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte,--I have the fact fromthe cashier himself,--by means of a false signature, to hand over tohim the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine. Thisconvict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact,you have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed theagent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is speakingto you, was present."Thenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man wholays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, inone instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returnedinstantly. The inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior mustbe wheedling.Thenardier contented himself with saying to Marius:"Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track."And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute anexpressive whirl."What!" broke forth Marius, "do you dispute that? These are facts.""They are chimeras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honorsme renders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before allthings. I do not like to see folks accused unjustly. Monsieur le Baron,Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not killJavert.""This is too much! How is this?""For two reasons.""What are they? Speak.""This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is JeanValjean himself who was M. Madeleine.""What tale are you telling me?""And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because theperson who killed Javert was Javert.""What do you mean to say?""That Javert committed suicide.""Prove it! prove it!" cried Marius beside himself.Thenardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancientAlexandrine measure:"Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change.""But prove it!"Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, whichseemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes."I have my papers," he said calmly.And he added:"Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjeanthoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and thesame man, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. IfI speak, it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs--writing issuspicious, handwriting is complaisant,--but printed proofs."As he spoke, Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies ofnewspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One ofthese two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemedmuch older than the other."Two facts, two proofs," remarked Thenardier. And he offered the twonewspapers, unfolded, to Marius.The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, anumber of the Drapeau Blanc of the 25th of July, 1823, the text ofwhich can be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M.Madeleine and Jean Valjean.The other, a Moniteur of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicideof Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to theprefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue dela Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgentwho, holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air, instead ofblowing out his brains.Marius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, thesetwo newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backingup Thenardier's statements; the note printed in the Moniteur had been anadministrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius couldnot doubt.The information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself hadbeen deceived.Jean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud.Marius could not repress a cry of joy."Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of thatfortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of awhole countryside! he is Jean Valjean, Javert's savior! he is a hero! heis a saint!""He's not a saint, and he's not a hero!" said Thenardier. "He's anassassin and a robber."And he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possessessome authority:"Let us be calm."Robber, assassin--those words which Marius thought had disappeared andwhich returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath."Again!" said he."Always," ejaculated Thenardier. "Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine,but he is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.""Will you speak," retorted Marius, "of that miserable theft, committedforty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a wholelife of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?""I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that Iam speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutelyunknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find init the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronneby Jean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature itwould not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whosecomforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one'scrime, and to enjoy one's theft, to bury one's name and to create foroneself a family.""I might interrupt you at this point," said Marius, "but go on.""Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to yourgenerosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: 'Whydo not you apply to Jean Valjean?' For a very simple reason; I knowthat he has stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and Iconsider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he wouldshow me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money formy trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who hasnothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take a chair."Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.Thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up his twonewspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as hepecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail: "It cost me a good deal oftrouble to get this one."That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back ofthe chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of whatthey are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizinghis words:"Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on theday of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at thepoint where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalidesand the Pont de Jena."Marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thenardier. Thenardiernoticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an oratorwho holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating underhis words:"This man, forced to conceal himself, and for reasons, moreover, whichare foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and hada key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have beeneight o'clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer.Greatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the soundof footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in hisdirection. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besideshimself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off.A little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize thenewcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back.He was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bentattitude was an ex-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulderswas a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there wassuch a thing. As for the theft, that is understood; one does not killa man gratis. This convict was on his way to fling the body into theriver. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the exitgrating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must,necessarily, have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems asthough he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have foundthe assassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire,and that did not suit the assassin's plans. He had preferred totraverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertions must have beenterrible, for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely; Idon't understand how he could have come out of that alive."Marius' chair approached still nearer. Thenardier took advantage of thisto draw a long breath. He went on:"Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lackseverything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet.That is what happened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by wereforced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. Thepasser-by said to the inhabitant:--"You see what I have on my back, Imust get out, you have the key, give it to me." That convict was a manof terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, theman who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the deadman, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was young, welldressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood.While talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, withoutthe assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man's coat. Adocument for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the traceof things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He putthis document for conviction in his pocket. After which he opened thegrating, made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back, closedthe grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with theremainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be presentwhen the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now youcomprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; theone who had the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece ofthe coat . . ."Thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and holding,on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and his twoforefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark spots.Marius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath,with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, withoututtering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, heretreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall fora key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney.He found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it withoutlooking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag whichThenardier still held outspread.But Thenardier continued:"Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing thatthe assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap byJean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money.""The young man was myself, and here is the coat!" cried Marius, and heflung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood.Then, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier, he croucheddown over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt.The rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat.Thenardier was petrified.This is what he thought: "I'm struck all of a heap."Marius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant.He fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thenardier, presentingto him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank-notesfor five hundred and a thousand francs."You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, a villain.You came to accuse that man, you have only justified him; you wanted toruin him, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. And it is you whoare the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you, ThenardierJondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital. I know enough aboutyou to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose. Here are athousand francs, bully that you are!"And he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier."Ah! Jondrette Thenardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson,you dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager ofthe shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here!Waterloo protects you.""Waterloo!" growled Thenardier, pocketing the five hundred francs alongwith the thousand."Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . .""Of a General," said Thenardier, elevating his head."Of a Colonel!" repeated Marius in a rage. "I wouldn't give a ha'pennyfor a general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you thatyou have committed all crimes. Go! disappear! Only be happy, that is allthat I desire. Ah! monster! here are three thousand francs more. Takethem. You will depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter;for your wife is dead, you abominable liar. I shall watch over yourdeparture, you ruffian, and at that moment I will count out to youtwenty thousand francs. Go get yourself hung elsewhere!""Monsieur le Baron!" replied Thenardier, bowing to the very earth,"eternal gratitude." And Thenardier left the room, understandingnothing, stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacksof gold, and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head inbank-bills.Struck by lightning he was, but he was also content; and he wouldhave been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off suchlightning as that.Let us finish with this man at once.Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he setout, thanks to Marius' care, for America under a false name, with hisdaughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousandfrancs.The moral wretchedness of Thenardier, the bourgeois who had missedhis vocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had been inEurope. Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a goodaction and to cause evil things to spring from it. With Marius' money,Thenardier set up as a slave-dealer.As soon as Thenardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden,where Cosette was still walking."Cosette! Cosette!" he cried. "Come! come quick! Let us go. Basque, acarriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let usnot lose a minute! Put on your shawl."Cosette thought him mad and obeyed.He could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain itsthrobbing. He paced back and forth with huge strides, he embracedCosette:"Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!" said he.Marius was bewildered. He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean ofsome indescribably lofty and melancholy figure. An unheard-of virtue,supreme and sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him. The convictwas transfigured into Christ.Marius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did not know precisely what hebeheld, but it was grand.In an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door.Marius helped Cosette in and darted in himself."Driver," said he, "Rue de l'Homme Arme, Number 7."The carriage drove off."Ah! what happiness!" ejaculated Cosette. "Rue de l'Homme Arme, I didnot dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean.""Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it.You told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you byGavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to thebarricade to save me. As it is a necessity with him to be an angel, hesaved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to giveme to you. He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer. Ah! Iam a monster of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your providence,he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire enough todrown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire. Cosette! he mademe traverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, I heard nothing, Icould know nothing of my own adventure. We are going to bring him back,to take him with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leaveus again. If only he is at home! Provided only that we can find him,I will pass the rest of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how itshould be, do you see, Cosette? Gavroche must have delivered my letterto him. All is explained. You understand."Cosette did not understand a word."You are right," she said to him.Meanwhile the carriage rolled on.CHAPTER V--A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAYJean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door."Come in," he said feebly.The door opened.Cosette and Marius made their appearance.Cosette rushed into the room.Marius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door."Cosette!" said Jean Valjean.And he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched and trembling,haggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes.Cosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean's breast."Father!" said she.Jean Valjean, overcome, stammered:"Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!"And, pressed close in Cosette's arms, he exclaimed:"It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!"Marius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing,took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted torepress his sobs:"My father!""And you also, you pardon me!" Jean Valjean said to him.Marius could find no words, and Jean Valjean added:"Thanks."Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed."It embarrasses me," said she.And, seating herself on the old man's knees, she put aside his whitelocks with an adorable movement, and kissed his brow.Jean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way.Cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled hercaresses, as though she desired to pay Marius' debt.Jean Valjean stammered:"How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again.Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, Iwas saying to myself: 'All is over. Here is her little gown, I am amiserable man, I shall never see Cosette again,' and I was saying thatat the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I anidiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons without the goodGod. The good God says:"'You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, thingswill not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of anangel.' And the angel comes, and one sees one's Cosette again! and onesees one's little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy."For a moment he could not speak, then he went on:"I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needsa bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. Igave myself reasons: 'They do not want you, keep in your own course,one has not the right to cling eternally.' Ah! God be praised, I see heronce more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? Ah!what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am fond ofthat pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then,thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her thou, MonsieurPontmercy. It will not be for long."And Cosette began again:"How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? Why haveyou stayed away so long? Formerly your journeys only lasted three orfour days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: 'He is absent.' Howlong have you been back? Why did you not let us know? Do you know thatyou are very much changed? Ah! what a naughty father! he has been ill,and we have not known it! Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand is!""So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!" repeated JeanValjean.At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, all that wasswelling Marius' heart found vent.He burst forth:"Cosette, do you hear? he has come to that! he asks my forgiveness! Anddo you know what he has done for me, Cosette? He has saved my life. Hehas done more--he has given you to me. And after having saved me, andafter having given you to me, Cosette, what has he done with himself? Hehas sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the ingrate,to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one: Thanks!Cosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be toolittle. That barricade, that sewer, that furnace, that cesspool,--allthat he traversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried me away throughall the deaths which he put aside before me, and accepted for himself.Every courage, every virtue, every heroism, every sanctity he possesses!Cosette, that man is an angel!""Hush! hush!" said Jean Valjean in a low voice. "Why tell all that?""But you!" cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, "whydid you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save people'slives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext ofunmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful.""I told the truth," replied Jean Valjean."No," retorted Marius, "the truth is the whole truth; and that you didnot tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You savedJavert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have saidso?""Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. Itwas necessary that I should go away. If you had known about that affair,of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was thereforeforced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have causedembarrassment in every way.""It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?" retorted Marius. "Doyou think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off. Ah!good heavens! when I reflect that it was by an accident that I havelearned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father,and mine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do notimagine that you will be here to-morrow.""To-morrow," said Jean Valjean, "I shall not be here, but I shall not bewith you.""What do you mean?" replied Marius. "Ah! come now, we are not going topermit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong tous. We shall not loose our hold of you.""This time it is for good," added Cosette. "We have a carriage at thedoor. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force."And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms."Your chamber still stands ready in our house," she went on. "If youonly knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing verywell there. The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violetshells. You shall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And nomore 'madame,' no more 'Monsieur Jean,' we are living under a Republic,everybody says thou, don't they, Marius? The programme is changed. Ifyou only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreastwhich had made her nest in a hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ateher. My poor, pretty, little robin red-breast which used to put her headout of her window and look at me! I cried over it. I should have likedto kill the cat. But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs,everybody is happy. You are going to come with us. How delightedgrandfather will be! You shall have your plot in the garden, you shallcultivate it, and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine asmine. And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, and then, you willobey me prettily."Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music ofher voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tearswhich are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.He murmured:"The proof that God is good is that she is here.""Father!" said Cosette.Jean Valjean continued:"It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together.Their trees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. It is sweet tobe among living people who bid each other 'good-day,' who call to eachother in the garden. People see each other from early morning. Weshould each cultivate our own little corner. She would make me eat herstrawberries. I would make her gather my roses. That would be charming.Only . . ."He paused and said gently:"It is a pity."The tear did not fall, it retreated, and Jean Valjean replaced it with asmile.Cosette took both the old man's hands in hers."My God!" said she, "your hands are still colder than before. Are youill? Do you suffer?""I? No," replied Jean Valjean. "I am very well. Only . . ."He paused."Only what?""I am going to die presently."Cosette and Marius shuddered."To die!" exclaimed Marius."Yes, but that is nothing," said Jean Valjean.He took breath, smiled and resumed:"Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breastis dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice."Marius gazed at the old man in amazement.Cosette uttered a heartrending cry."Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist uponyour living, do you hear?"Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration."Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was onthe verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me thatI was born again.""You are full of strength and life," cried Marius. "Do you imagine thata person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no more.It is I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going tolive, and to live with us, and to live a long time. We take possessionof you once more. There are two of us here who will henceforth have noother thought than your happiness.""You see," resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, "that Marius says thatyou shall not die."Jean Valjean continued to smile."Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, wouldthat make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself,and he does not change his mind; it is useful for me to go. Death isa good arrangement. God knows better than we what we need. May you behappy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning,may there be around you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may yourlife be a beautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven fillyour souls, and now let me, who am good for nothing, die; it is certainthat all this is right. Come, be reasonable, nothing is possible now, Iam fully conscious that all is over. And then, last night, I drank thatwhole jug of water. How good thy husband is, Cosette! Thou art muchbetter off with him than with me."A noise became audible at the door.It was the doctor entering."Good-day, and farewell, doctor," said Jean Valjean. "Here are my poorchildren."Marius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this singleword: "Monsieur? . . ." But his manner of pronouncing it contained acomplete question.The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance."Because things are not agreeable," said Jean Valjean, "that is noreason for being unjust towards God."A silence ensued.All breasts were oppressed.Jean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though hewished to retain her features for eternity.In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, ecstasywas still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. The reflection of thatsweet face lighted up his pale visage.The doctor felt of his pulse."Ah! it was you that he wanted!" he murmured, looking at Cosette andMarius.And bending down to Marius' ear, he added in a very low voice:"Too late."Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost withoutceasing to gaze at Cosette.These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth:"It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live."All at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength aresometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step tothe wall, thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him,detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspendedthere, and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement ofperfect health, and said in a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on thetable:"Behold the great martyr."Then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication ofthe tomb were seizing hold upon him.His hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails intothe stuff of his trousers.Cosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and tried to speak to him,but could not.Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompaniestears, they distinguished words like the following:"Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only tolose you again?"It might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towardsthe sepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the actionof dying.Jean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as thoughto make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucidonce more.He took a fold of Cosette's sleeve and kissed it."He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back," cried Marius."You are good, both of you," said Jean Valjean. "I am going to tell youwhat has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, is thatyou have not been willing to touch that money. That money really belongsto your wife. I will explain to you, my children, and for that reason,also, I am glad to see you. Black jet comes from England, white jetcomes from Norway. All this is in this paper, which you will read. Forbracelets, I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheetiron, slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better and lesscostly. You will understand how much money can be made in that way. SoCosette's fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in orderthat your mind may be set at rest."The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door.The doctor dismissed her.But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dyingman before she disappeared: "Would you like a priest?""I have had one," replied Jean Valjean.And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head whereone would have said that he saw some one.It is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this deathagony.Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins.Jean Valjean resumed:"Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundredthousand francs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been wastedif you do not enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glassgoods. We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. However, we couldnot equal the black glass of England. A gross, which contains twelvehundred very well cut grains, only costs three francs."When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze uponhim with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fainhold him back.Cosette gave her hand to Marius, and both, mute with anguish, notknowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairingbefore him.Jean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing nearto the gloomy horizon.His breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it.He found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost allmovement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feeblenessof body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spreadover his brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in hiseyes.His face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was somethingelse.His breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which thewings could be felt.He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minuteof the last hour had, evidently, arrived.He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to comefrom a distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose betweenthem and him."Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! how good itis to die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. I knew wellthat thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it wasof thee to place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me alittle, wilt thou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any realgriefs. You must enjoy yourselves a great deal, my children. I forgotto tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles withouttongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francsand sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So there is nooccasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, MonsieurPontmercy. It is honest money. You may be rich with a tranquil mind.Thou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then, andhandsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then, thou must give good dinnersto thy friends, and be very happy. I was writing to Cosette a while ago.She will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two candlesticks whichstand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, but to me they are gold,they are diamonds; they change candles which are placed in them intowax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave them to me ispleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. My children,you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have me buried in thefirst plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. Thisis my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come for a littlewhile now and then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, MonsieurPontmercy. I must admit that I have not always loved you. I ask yourpardon for that. Now she and you form but one for me. I feel verygrateful to you. I am sure that you make Cosette happy. If you onlyknew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight; when Isaw her in the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of drawers, there isa bank-bill for five hundred francs. I have not touched it. It is forthe poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dostthou recognize it? That was ten years ago, however. How time flies! Wehave been very happy. All is over. Do not weep, my children, I am notgoing very far, I shall see you from there, you will only have tolook at night, and you will see me smile. Cosette, dost thou rememberMontfermeil? Thou wert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dostthou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket? Thatwas the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold!Ah! your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now. Andthe big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thouregrettedest not having taken her to the convent! How thou didst makeme laugh sometimes, my sweet angel! When it had been raining, thou didstfloat bits of straw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One dayI gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue andgreen feathers. Thou hast forgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thoudidst play. Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things ofthe past. The forests through which one has passed with one's child, thetrees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has concealedoneself, the games, the hearty laughs of childhood, are shadows. Iimagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay my stupidity. ThoseThenardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them. Cosette, the momenthas come to tell thee the name of thy mother. She was called Fantine.Remember that name--Fantine. Kneel whenever thou utterest it. Shesuffered much. She loved thee dearly. She had as much unhappiness asthou hast had happiness. That is the way God apportions things. He isthere on high, he sees us all, and he knows what he does in the midst ofhis great stars. I am on the verge of departure, my children. Love eachother well and always. There is nothing else but that in the world: lovefor each other. You will think sometimes of the poor old man who diedhere. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed, that I have not seenthee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went as far as the cornerof the street, I must have produced a queer effect on the people whosaw me pass, I was like a madman, I once went out without my hat. I nolonger see clearly, my children, I had still other things to say, butnever mind. Think a little of me. Come still nearer. I die happy. Giveme your dear and well-beloved heads, so that I may lay my hands uponthem."Cosette and Marius fell on their knees, in despair, suffocating withtears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean's hands. Those august hands nolonger moved.He had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him.His white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius tocover his hands with kisses.He was dead.The night was starless and extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom, someimmense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul.[Illustration: Darkness  5b9-1-Darkness]CHAPTER VI--THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACESIn the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common grave,far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, far from allthe tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all thehideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, beside an old wall,beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus, amiddandelions and mosses, there lies a stone. That stone is no more exemptthan others from the leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens andfrom the defilement of the birds. The water turns it green, the airblackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond ofwalking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feetare immediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizardscome thither. All around there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring,linnets warble in the trees.This stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was therequirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make thestone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.No name is to be read there.Only, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines,which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust, andwhich are, to-day, probably effaced:           Il dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange,           Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange.           La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva,           Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.[70]LETTER TO M. DAELLIPublisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in Milan.                               HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862.You are right, sir, when you tell me that Les Miserables is written forall nations. I do not know whether it will be read by all, but I wroteit for all. It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to Italy aswell as to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to Republics whichhave slaves as well as to Empires which have serfs. Social problemsoverstep frontiers. The sores of the human race, those great sores whichcover the globe, do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon themap. In every place where man is ignorant and despairing, in every placewhere woman is sold for bread, wherever the child suffers for lack ofthe book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warmhim, the book of Les Miserables knocks at the door and says: "Open tome, I come for you."At the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, and whichis still so sombre, the miserable's name is Man; he is agonizing in allclimes, and he is groaning in all languages.Your Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France. Youradmirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it. Does not banditism,that raging form of pauperism, inhabit your mountains? Few nations aremore deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I have endeavored tofathom. In spite of your possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin,Florence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice, aheroic history, sublime ruins, magnificent ruins, and superb cities,you are, like ourselves, poor. You are covered with marvels and vermin.Assuredly, the sun of Italy is splendid, but, alas, azure in the skydoes not prevent rags on man.Like us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms,blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs. You taste nothing ofthe present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingledwith it. You have a barbarian, the monk, and a savage, the lazzarone.The social question is the same for you as for us. There are a few lessdeaths from hunger with you, and a few more from fever; your socialhygiene is not much better than ours; shadows, which are Protestant inEngland, are Catholic in Italy; but, under different names, the vescovois identical with the bishop, and it always means night, and of prettynearly the same quality. To explain the Bible badly amounts to the samething as to understand the Gospel badly.Is it necessary to emphasize this? Must this melancholy parallelismbe yet more completely verified? Have you not indigent persons? Glancebelow. Have you not parasites? Glance up. Does not that hideous balance,whose two scales, pauperism and parasitism, so mournfully preserve theirmutual equilibrium, oscillate before you as it does before us? Whereis your army of schoolmasters, the only army which civilizationacknowledges?Where are your free and compulsory schools? Does every one know how toread in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo? Have you made publicschools of your barracks? Have you not, like ourselves, an opulentwar-budget and a paltry budget of education? Have not you also thatpassive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience?military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme offiring upon Garibaldi; that is to say, upon the living honor of Italy?Let us subject your social order to examination, let us take it where itstands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant offences, show me thewoman and the child. It is by the amount of protection with which thesetwo feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilizationis to be measured. Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than inParis? What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and whatamount of justice springs from your tribunals? Do you chance to be sofortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words: publicprosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the executioner, thedeath penalty? Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead andFarinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons.Have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality andpolitics? You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes!Something very similar has been done in France. Stay, let us passmiseries in review, let each one contribute his pile, you are as richas we. Have you not, like ourselves, two condemnations, religiouscondemnation pronounced by the priest, and social condemnation decreedby the judge? Oh, great nation of Italy, thou resemblest the greatnation of France! Alas! our brothers, you are, like ourselves,Miserables.From the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do not see much moredistinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of Eden. Only, thepriests are mistaken. These holy portals are before and not behind us.I resume. This book, Les Miserables, is no less your mirror than ours.Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,--Iunderstand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; thatdoes not prevent them from being of use.As for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love for my owncountry, but without being engrossed by France more than by any othernation. In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and Ibecome more and more patriotic for humanity.This is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of radianceof the French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French,Italian, German, Spanish, or English, and become European, I say more,human, if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization.Hence a new logic of art, and of certain requirements of compositionwhich modify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, of tasteand language, which must grow broader like all the rest.In France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great delight,with having transgressed the bounds of what they call "French taste"; Ishould be glad if this eulogium were merited.In short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same universalsuffering, and I try to assuage it, I possess only the puny forces of aman, and I cry to all: "Help me!"This, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it for you andfor your country. If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of onephrase in your letter. You write:--"There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say: 'This book, LesMiserables, is a French book. It does not concern us. Let the Frenchread it as a history, we read it as a romance.'"--Alas! I repeat,whether we be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. Ever sincehistory has been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, miseryhas been the garment of the human race; the moment has at length arrivedfor tearing off that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked limbs of theMan-People, the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robeof the dawn.If this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds andin dissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty to publish it,sir. Accept, I pray you, a renewed assurance of my very distinguishedsentiments.

When, by adding your age to my age, we couldnot count forty years between us, and when, in our humble and tinyhousehold, everything was spring to us even in winter. Fair days!Manuel was proud and wise, Paris sat at sacred banquets, Foy launchedthunderbolts, and your corsage had a pin on which I pricked myself.Everything gazed upon you. A briefless lawyer, when I took you to thePrado to dine, you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turnround, and I heard them say: Is she not beautiful! How good she smells!What billowing hair! Beneath her mantle she hides a wing. Her charmingbonnet is hardly unfolded. I wandered with thee, pressing thy supplearm. The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded, in our happycouple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of May. We livedconcealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, that sweetforbidden fruit. My mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart hadalready responded. The Sorbonne was the bucolic spot where I adored theefrom eve till morn. 'Tis thus that an amorous soul applies the chart ofthe Tender to the Latin country. O Place Maubert! O Place Dauphine!When in the fresh spring-like hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thydelicate leg, I saw a star in the depths of the garret. I have reada great deal of Plato, but nothing of it remains by me; better thanMalebranche and then Lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestialgoodness with a flower which thou gavest to me, I obeyed thee, thoudidst submit to me; oh gilded garret! to lace thee! to behold thee goingand coming from dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thineancient mirror! And who, then, would forego the memory of those days ofaurora and the firmament, of flowers, of gauze and of moire, when lovestammers a charming slang? Our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips;thou didst mask the window with thy petticoat; I took the earthenwarebowl and I gave thee the Japanese cup. And those great misfortunes whichmade us laugh! Thy cuff scorched, thy boa lost! And that dear portraitof the divine Shakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup! Iwas a beggar and thou wert charitable. I kissed thy fresh round armsin haste. A folio Dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily acentime's worth of chestnuts. The first time that, in my joyous den, Isnatched a kiss from thy fiery lip, when thou wentest forth, dishevelledand blushing, I turned deathly pale and I believed in God. Dost thourecall our innumerable joys, and all those fichus changed to rags? Oh!what sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenlydepths!][Footnote 54: My nose is in tears, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thygendarmes that I may say a word to them.
