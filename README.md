# aho-corasick

this repo contains a rust implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm for comparison with a native javascript version.

this is my first slightly substantial rust program so any comments are welcome.
i need to rework the typing of the states to get rid of ubiquitous "as usize"
phrases, but it (appears) to work.

next: testing.
